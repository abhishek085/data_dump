This decision was guided by an in-depth understanding of the problem statement and customer needs. I spent most of my first week going through documentations provided by my mentor and meeting him to clarify my doubts. A comprehensive understanding of the problem area was key, as it inspired customer-focused solutions and ensured that I was able to back my solutions if I received pushback from anyone. In the entire product development process, the PdM acts as the voice of the customer and ensures that the features being built address the customerâ€™s needs in the most effective manner.\nStakeholder Management \nThroughout my internship, cross-functional leadership was necessary to ensure the successful shipping of the MVP. It was my responsibility to keep the business user abreast of the progress and take feedback from them. We used JIRA, a project tracking software solution, to capture feature requests and assign tasks to the engineering team. I regularly met with the program manager, initially to groom JIRA stories and later in sprint meetings to understand the progress made in the productâ€™s development. Having a 360-degree view of the project from both business and technical sides was important as it enabled me to make informed decisions when I had to solve unforeseen problems. \nEvangelizing the solution\nAs a PdM, you are the cheerleader for your product. I spent a lot of time initially understanding the impact of the solution that I was working on. Through the course of the internship, I honed my data-driven storytelling skills as they were necessary to showcase the impact of the solution to the business leadership using tools like Python, pandas, Tableau heavily. I worked along with a business analyst to get data points relevant to the operations and used them to create Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which were instrumental when communicating with product and business leaders.\n#utdmsba ', '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines), Personal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'I have shadowed into three different groups: Data Stewardship, Data Governance, and Master Data Mana ...', 'This Fall, I had an opportunity to work with the wonderful folks at Copart.

Iâ€™ve gotten the chance to work as both the Junior Associate in their Regional Sales team as well as in their Private Client Initiatives team. Initially, I was nervous, timid, and unsure of myself throughout the entire training process. But as time passed, I began to learn more about my role from my mentors, leaders, and peers. I gained confidence in my abilities and became more comfortable in a corporate setting, something I wasnâ€™t sure I could do. Those who Iâ€™ve met at Fisher have been very supportive and encouraging every step of the way and continue to help support me as I learn more about my role and as I explore other potential positions within Fisher. \nI had the opportunity to learn about Fisher and its processes as an associate, I would support their sales directly, contact clients and assist them by handling operational tasks. I also had an opportunity to learn about how my role is connected to other roles such as investment counselors, account executives, financial planners, and investment counselors among the many roles here at Fisher. My experience at Fisher has helped me to improve my skills, helped me to learn more about the financial industry, and how to grow as a professional. Being able to learn in an environment like Fisher has been incredibly fun and I had time to experience what itâ€™s like to work in corporate in a comfortable and supportive environment. As I continue to grow in my career I hope to take what Iâ€™ve learned and apply it to all my future endeavors. \n#UTDBSFIN #hireJSOM ', '\n\t\t\tJSOM Handshake, Internet (e.g. company website, job search engines), Personal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'My experience with Marten Transport was great.

There was no point throughout my internship that I felt as though I wasnâ€™t able/allowed to ask for help, nor a time where I felt under trained for a problem.

I worked with a group of developers from around the world and demonstrated effective collaboration skills. I also completed multiple training courses to expand my knowledge of ABAP.\nWorking and communicating with clients on the Talos project has helped expand my skillset as a consultant.

We have encountered different types of brokerage accounts, retirements, and others. Still, the primary accounts we had to deal with were the brokerage accounts and using different systems to process them. My position consists of processing what they called it: doing account maintenance for customers by managing the relationships they want to establish within their people by giving them some authority on their accounts. We are also responsible for adding account features, such as ordering checks, deposit slips, debit cards, and bill pay. Other maintenance will be name changes and address changes. We would also add beneficiaries to retirement or health insurance and non-retirement accounts. We also establish withdrawals and investments with the electronic transfer of funds between accounts. The brokerage operation position helped me learn how the financial industry works and the market with the training provided to process clients' requests.

The listing was for a loan assistant in the hard money business, which was something that I needed to gain experience with. But after interviewing with the folks there, I realized they are some of the friendliest and most intelligent people I've ever met; they were willing to show me everything from scratch and taught me valuable knowledge and experience. I started the internship in the summer, and it was perfect timing for me to absorb everything since there were no school schedule conflicts. Jay, the president, walked me through and breakdown the company's structure and mission. Seeing the company's statistics and how loans are secured was terrific. The senior loan officer Eugene is highly experienced in construction management and has an enormous clientele for his loans. Eugene showed me all the steps and critical techniques to secure a loan; there is much more than just interest rates to make a successful loan. I learned how to analyze property values throughout the internship; the analysis factor in securing a loan is so important. The loan coordinator Ivy is absolutely one of the hardest workers I've ever met. She is responsible in the background for coordinating all the tasks to ensure the loan is being secured smoothly until it is paid off. I learned so much from Ivy, and I realized how important it is to understand how everything is done, starting from the bottom level. This internship is the best job experience I've ever had! With another step closer to graduation, the internship is coming to an end. However, it is not the end of the journey with HiFi Hard Money yet! They offered me a full-time position, and I am excited to continue to the next chapter of my life! Once again, I want to thank UTD for the excellent university experience and HiFi Hard Money for being a fantastic employer! #UTDBSFIN #hireJSOM "", '\n\t\t\tJSOM career event\t\t\t', 'My experience with Marten Transport was great.

Founded in 2012, Clairvoyant has consistently been named among the fastest growing and most innovative privately held companies in the U.S. Headquartered in Phoenix, AZ. At Clairvoyant, I worked as a Project Management Intern for the Customer Success Engagement team at the Clairvoyant Texas Headquarters in Dallas Fort-Worth, Texas. During my internship, I had the valuable chance to foster my abilities in Project Management and Data Analytics. \nMy time at Clairvoyant for the past few months has been incredibly insightful, and I am grateful to Clairvoyant for inculcating the culture of constant learning. I love how every member of Clairvoyant goes with the spirit of Day 1 and thrives to give their best every day. Being part of this team motivated me to give everything that it takes to complete any task daily. Transparency amongst everyone in the company is one of the critical factors to the success of Clairvoyant- I was surprised to see that I could ping the executive leadership team, such as the CEO, CFO, CTO, etc., with as much ease as I can ping any of my fellow teammates or interns.  \nFurthermore, I have also worked alongside Mandar Samant (Vice-president of Customer Engagement), who served as my mentor and manager during my time at Clairvoyant. While working alongside Mandar, I got the opportunity to expand my knowledge in Project Management and Operations Handling through various tools such as Google Database systems and Microsoft excel to understand what it takes to manage a project. I am incredibly grateful to work with great mentor like Mandar during my summer internship.\nI am delighted to inform that this journey does not stop here, and thereâ€™s more to go as my internship gets extended for another semester this coming Spring. I am excited to see what is in store for the coming term and cannot wait to learn and grow with the Clairvoyant team.\n#utdmsitm ', '\n\t\t\tFaculty referral\t\t\t', 'Hello Connection!\n\nMy internship at Ayoka Systems is in its second semester.

When offered a position as an intern, I was beyond ecstatic. I worked and prepared for years to land an internship and for that to become my reality was truly a valuable feeling I will never forget. Along the way, I was able to learn finance specific knowledge, better my technology skills, build valuable relationships with both the management team and the front-end employees, and take a peek into the inner workings of the executive teams. The most important lesson I gained from my internship, however, is the importance of soft skills. A team is nothing if communication and empathy is nonexistent. Going into the internship, I had the belief that as long as I had â€œgood enoughâ€ technical skills, I could excel. With time, I realized without proper organization, communication, and time management, the tasks assigned at work was difficult to complete. Although gaining technical experience was crucial in my experience, creating a connection of friends and support proved to be the ultimate winner of my success at Watts. #hireJSOM #UTDBSFIN ', '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines), Personal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'As I am reaching the end of my college career, I wanted to take a moment and reflect on my internshi ...', 'This past summer, I had the pleasure of interning at CeeChat as the Project Management Intern in Hou ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

Although this department was busy on an important project regarding the acquisition of another corporation, they did their best to ensure I had an insight into what this department entails. I had the opportunity to connect with my team and join their weekly meetings, which allowed me to understand how professional meetings are conducted and how vital communication is to ensure everyone is on the same page and that the teamâ€™s goals are aligned with the organizationâ€™s. \nI learned so much from everyone at Gainwell, especially my mentors. Towards the end, along with the interns team, I concluded this project with a more elaborated and specific program layout and a copy personalized to each department. This second copy was crucial as the specifications and deadlines allowed each department to be fully informed and aware of deadlines and intern goals to assure successful wins for both the organization and the intern.\nOn the other side, working along so many knowledgeable people allowed me to make meaningful connections. I made sure to connect through LinkedIn and researched every person I requested to talk to have enough information on their background and ask the appropriate questions, so time could be used efficiently and increase the chances to make an impression and convey professionalism. Towards the end of the internship, I connected with more than 20 people. However, meaningful connections who understood who I was and provided me with more than professional advice were about ten people. These last group of people helped me to grasp a better understanding of the HR field and tried to provide me with as much professional advice as possible. They knew what my goals were and understood how important it was for me to feel more confident about deciding which department to focus on as I approach graduation and adventure into developing my professional career. The most valuable experience for me throughout the internship was learning about peopleâ€™s different professional paths and how many of them evolved regardless of their major. In contrast, others developed the best out of their specialized degrees. \nLastly, regarding my need to clarify what path I will take once I graduate, I was advised not to box myself in one specific area but to transition to all the HR departments instead. This will provide me with so much knowledge to essentially be able to occupy a leadership position, which is my end goal. I can also say that in quality, I walk out with the type of connections I was looking for and an experience that will allow me to improve my performance in my next job. This learning experience will also help me put into better perspective and better understand my last courses at the university. \n#UTDMSMSc #GainwellIntern #GainwellTechnologies #humanResources #UTD #experience #team #development #learning #culture #hrcommunity ', '\n\t\t\tFaculty referral\t\t\t', 'As my internship comes to an end, I want to reflect on my experience and what I have learned at Good ...', 'I had the greatest pleasure of interning at CAE USA this fall semester.

I am sharing my experience working at the company and the project that I was able to lead.\nFrom the beginning, I wanted to create a strong foundation and understanding of the business problem. The task was to optimize the current CRM system and integrate beneficial modules. I looked to the System Development Life Cycle to help create a framework to approach the problem. Breaking the project into four stages, planning, analysis, design, and implementation.\nThe system planning began with weekly calls and meetings that were held throughout the project and assisted in identifying business needs. I conducted an analysis of the current system and the objective goals,  comparing the available internal and external software, allowing me to structure the best possible solutions that would help the company save time and reallocate efforts to more critical tasks. I worked to construct the basis of the system and tested the system and its components. Such as proper data tracking, data accuracy, and data translation when using the system. The solutions included manipulating datasets to create KPIs used for performance tracking. I created dashboards used to visualize relevant datasets that followed the sales pipeline. The invoicing system was improved and configured to maintain high shareability and consistency.\nSome skills I got exposed to were time management during the planning and analysis phase, where identifying the problem and solutions required multitasking to meet deadlines. Clear communication was crucial during the meetings, asking the right questions to receive the right answers. Throughout the project, adaptability transpired when the demands and requirements changed, requiring a new look at the problem and potential solutions.\nThe internship was an incredible experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity that Clayton Vette at Alpha Construction Group has given me.

These plans were designed to help clients achieve their financial goals through various investment, insurance, and retirement opportunities.\nI analyzed various investment options and recommended a diversified portfolio to clients. This portfolio generated an average return of 8% over a 12-month period, which helped clients achieve their financial goals while providing a healthy return on investment.\nI also collaborated with senior Financial Advisors to develop and implement investment strategies for over 50 clients.\nThis opportunity provided me with significant insights into the day-to-day workings of financial planning and helped me develop the essential skills and knowledge needed to succeed in this field.\nOverall, my internship at Primerica provided me with valuable insights and practical experience in the financial services industry. I am so grateful to get this exposure with such a great company. \n#greateful #thankyou #UTDBSFIN #hireJSOM ', '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines)\t\t\t', 'For the past 2 semesters, I have had the amazing opportunity to work as a finance intern at Nanoscop ...', 'My internship experience at Emersons Commercial Real Estate was amazing!

It was a valuable experience where I discovered how important the analysts are in the company and also understood how data analytics can be used for different areas such as logistics field. This internship experience not only taught me to implement the skills in a practical way but also gave me a goal of being an operation analyst in my future career and I would like to write more about it.\nFirst and foremost, I was working as an operation analyst during the internship, which was a very important role in our company since it provides a service including import and export of sea freight contracting, air cargo contracting, customs declaration, and truck delivery. The responsibility for this position was to analyze demand requirements, plan, schedule, and monitor work center output to improve operational efficiency and meet customer requirements. In addition, I also need to develop new clients and maintain relationships between the company and its clients, which is an Important task in our team.\nSecondly, as an operation analyst, the daily job requirement was to design a model to predict order amounts and analyzed how to improve profitability. Also, I needed to generate Excel-based reports to analyze monthly timesheet datasets using MYSOFT system. This required professional knowledge or skills that I had initially not experienced. But, I could say that the courses (SPREADSHEET MODELING & ANALYTICS and PRESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS FOR DATA SCIENCE) that I have taken at UTD gave me a foundation in programming and analysis so I decided to dive more deeply into the logistics side.\nFinally, I could not be more grateful for this amazing opportunity working as an intern in a large global logistics company. Through this internship, I have gotten more hands-on experience with analytical tools and developing the costumers. Furthermore, I will be well-equipped for an analyst position in the future.\n#UTDMSBA #work #analyst ', '\n\t\t\tPersonal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'I have been interning with Crescent Bank since June 2022, and it has been a joyful, rich, and memora ...', 'My Graduate Internship at Tenaska Power Services was one of the most rewarding experiences I have ha ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

This integration helped to improve overall supply chain visibility and efficiency, as it allowed us to track inventory levels and shipments in real-time. Through using the WMS, I was able to develop my communication and project management skills, while also gaining a deeper understanding of the importance of data integration in logistics operations.\nIn addition to my work on the WMS integration project, I was responsible for generating weekly reports for 1000+ overseas storage items, which involved performing accurate data entry into the system. This task required a high level of attention to detail, as even small errors could have significant consequences for inventory management and shipping. Moreover, I monitored 100+ shipments from origin to destination, ensuring timely delivery and issue resolution via email. This made me to be proactive and detail-oriented, as I needed to stay on top of shipments and address any issues that arose in a timely and effective manner.\nFinally, I would like to thank Soonest for providing me with this opportunity to work in Logistic field.

I accepted the incredible opportunity to intern at Lakes Regional in late February, and I have come to greatly enjoy and appreciate my time interning under Chris Cox, and helping out around the Terrell office as well as the other regional offices. My time at Lakes Regional has put my knowledge to the test with real-world IT challenges that I was able to overcome and feel proud about. Additionally, Iâ€™ve gained not only experience with IT-based operations and equipment, but also connecting with the people side of daily operations on an interpersonal level. \n\tAs far as technical skills go, I have certainly learned quite a bit. One of the first skills I began to build up at Lakes Regional was the ins-and-outs of network switching. With guidance and oversight, I was able to learn the ability to create and replace network cables and install new access ports for them. Additionally, I learned very much regarding IT-related equipment and hardware, such as building, repairing, replacing, and installing both hardware and software essential to the daily operations of Lakes Regional.\nOne of the projects related to IT-equipment and hardware that really stuck with me was when I was tasked with constructing a telemed stand and rigging the television monitor and PC to the stand as a complete and functioning product. I was quite proud of this achievement as I know that equipment is critical to daily operations within Lakes Regional, and will see thorough and continuous use for the foreseeable future. Leaving an impact was not something I initially thought Iâ€™d be able to do as an Intern, but Iâ€™m proud to have surprised myself in that regard.\nAnother area of knowledge I have learned from is helpdesk ticketing. After a great deal of shadowing and eventually tackling on my own, I picked up on how to manage tickets from an IT-helpdesk perspective. I learned how best to approach situations and how to troubleshoot, as well as applying critical thinking in conjunction with skills and experience to resolve issues.\n\tOverall, as I mentioned previously, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity extended to me by Chris and the wonderful people at Lakes Regional Community Center. While I was initially intimidated by the prospect of finally diving into the professional world, Lakes Regional has done a tremendous job at making me feel welcome and a valued member of the team despite me only being a student intern. I learned so much from my time as an intern, and I canâ€™t wait to use what Iâ€™ve learned to build my career in the future, wherever it may take me.

Arvinas, a biopharmaceutical company established in 2013, is a leader in targeted protein degradation technology and has made remarkable progress in oncology, immuno-oncology, and neuroscience. Specifically, I was a member of the Technical Operations team, a team responsible for designing processes and overseeing the end-to-end manufacturing and supply chain of drug products.\nAt first, my focus was on streamlining Quality Assurance processes to optimize global product release. I developed a macro-enabled spreadsheet tool to identify suitable markets for releasing products based on varying product specifications. This led to a faster processing time and automated the documentation process, resulting in significant improvements.\nIn addition to the Quality Assurance Process, I also contributed to business process mapping, which involved strategically analyzing and visually representing the flow of processes in various areas. This initiative was instrumental in promoting transparency in the supply chain and fostering clear communication among different departments within the company.\nSubsequently, I had the opportunity to focus on demand planning for company requirements. My role involved creating forecast scenario analyses across various levels of the supply chain, from regulatory starting materials to drug products, while considering factors such as expiry dates and production capacity constraints. These analyses helped identify risks or product expiration or inventory management costs and stockouts. Additionally, this approach facilitated better communication among various levels of the supply chain.\nIn general, my time at Arvinas has enabled me to gain a broad understanding of various pharmaceutical supply chains. The most significant takeaway from this experience has been understanding the crucial components involved in establishing a supply chain for new product development. This role has also allowed me to refine my operations management and strategic skills by exposing me to the development and manufacturing processes within the pharmaceutical industry.\nI wanted to express my appreciation to Prateek N. Bhargava for his invaluable guidance and support. His mentorship has been incredibly helpful in helping me develop my skills both professionally and personally. Thank you for being an Incredible mentor.\nI would like to convey my gratitude to N. Murti Vemuri for recognizing my contributions and for being a constant source of motivation and inspiration. as well as to the entire Arvinas team for an exceptional learning experience.\n#UTDMSSCM #hireJSOM ', '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines)\t\t\t', ""As I approach the completion of my Master's degree in Supply Chain Management, I want to take a mome ..."", 'My Spring-2023 internship experience at Tesla Inc.\nAs I reach into the final week of my Sprin ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

The first time coming into a real-world corporate setting made me nervous, and I wasnâ€™t sure if I could make it through. But the people at Bell have helped me settle quickly and made me feel comfortable with their kindness and support. Being part of the infrastructure team helped me gain a ton of knowledge. It made me work on various projects such as Share Point, IGEL, PCoIP upgrades, ServiceNow, and Database management.\nOne of the primary projects I worked on would be IGEL software deployment. We were required to go to various manufacturing sites and convert the computers to IGEL software. This helped improve the functioning and secure access to virtual environments. In the beginning, I was overwhelmed with everything being new as I didnâ€™t know how the tech worked in the real world, and there were numerous computers to convert with the time we were given. Everything seemed quick and complex and was nothing like what was taught in school. This project required much technical knowledge to ensure the conversion was successful and work with Excel to keep track of the list. A special thanks to  Justin H., who guided me throughout this project and answered any number of questions until I completely comprehended it. I could network through this process with the entire Infrastructure team, who were extremely talented, and I gained a ton of knowledge working with tools such as ServiceNow, and IGEL UMS, which I never knew how to work with or existed. Later, I was able to complete the conversions myself and additionally help the site workers with many other technical issues they had.\nIâ€™d like to thank my manager, Jarod Shaw, for welcoming me to the team and providing me with challenging and meaningful projects to work on, and placing trust in my work.

Through my internship, I developed strong written and verbal communication skills that allowed me to communicate efficiently with team members and the manager. We had group meetings every day before starting work, reviewing issues from the previous day and setting a plan for the day ahead. I also made presentations for sharing what I had determined and my suggestions for solutions.\nOne of the most beneficial projects I worked on throughout my internship was conducting a website audit.

As someone who had never worked in the field of IT consulting before, I was initially nervous about the completely remote nature of the internship. I was unsure about how I would be able to connect with my team without ever meeting them face-to-face. However, I quickly learned that adaptability was key to being successful in a remote work environment.\nOur primary goal during the internship was to improve the company's CRM system. For those unfamiliar with CRM systems, they are software tools that help businesses manage their interactions with customers and potential customers. As we began to work on the CRM, we quickly encountered several challenges that we had to overcome. For example, we were only given access to the browser version of ACT, which meant that we were unable to access certain features of the software. Additionally, we found that the system was sluggish and inefficient, taking several minutes to retrieve customer data due to the presence of irrelevant rows and redundant data in the database.\nDespite these challenges, our team collaborated effectively to identify areas for improvement within the CRM. We worked together to clean up the database, removing any redundant or irrelevant data, and bringing the issue to the attention of our supervisor. Furthermore, we were tasked with researching specific tools within the ACT CRM and learning how to implement them to improve the system's efficiency. For instance, we focused on automating routine tasks such as data entry, follow-up emails, and appointment scheduling to free up the company's time for more complex tasks and customer interactions. \nThrough this internship experience, I gained a deep understanding of the importance of problem-solving skills, adaptability, and effective collaboration. I learned to think critically and to communicate effectively with my team members despite being in a remote work environment. I also learned how to use technology to improve business processes and customer interactions.

Scott Schieffer, P.C., not only did I have a chance to gain hands-on experience and develop my technical skills by working on several projects, but I also had the chance to work alongside experienced professionals and get personal supervision from the firm's owner. \nDuring my internship, I was able to put my classroom knowledge of Accounting and IT to practice in the real world. I achieved this by using Microsoft Excel and the Drake Tax Software to prepare several financial documents and tax returns for many individuals, partnerships, and corporations. Preparing these documents enhanced my ability to analyze complex data, identify potential issues, and develop creative solutions. Additionally, I used several Excel Functions and pivot tables, to organize and establish relationships between big data. \nAs R. Scott Schieffer, P.C., is also a law firm, I was exposed to learning about estate planning documents and sitting in on client meetings where I was responsible for taking notes; this increased my ability to pay attention to detail and allowed me to interact with varied individuals professionally. \nFrom dressing up professionally to work every day to communicating more clearly and concisely within the firm and with the clients, I have had the opportunity to develop my professional skills drastically through this internship. The constant feedback from the firm's owner has also been a blessing in disguise as it has pushed me out of my comfort zone to try and meet the expectations and put my best foot forward throughout my time at work.\nOne of the biggest takeaways from my experience at the internship was the importance of communicating clearly when working in a team and accepting all different viewpoints to get the best results. Additionally, I have learned to take on new challenges and step out of my comfort zone to grab new opportunities and gain new skills. Being an ITS major, preparing tax returns using accounting principles did not exactly flow in as being my area of expertise during the start of the internship, but taking on this challenge and being able to prepare tax returns successfully indeed increased my self-confidence and helped me become more adaptable to new challenges. \nOverall, my internship at R. Scott Schieffer, P.C. has been incredibly valuable. As my first internship, it has undoubtedly helped me grow in various ways and helped me gain the technical and soft skills I will use throughout my career.\n#UTDBSITS #JSOMINTERN #JSOM "", '\n\t\t\tJSOM Handshake\t\t\t', 'Bank of Montreal is the first Canadian bank founded in Montreal in 1817.

Global One was a recently established bank so there were about fifteen employees but I actually really appreciated this aspect, as it made my time there much more personal as I was working hands on with all of the employees and I think I was able to learn a lot more this way, rather than being one worker out of two hundred shadowing a singular other worker. I am very appreciative of the opportunity I have received by getting to work here and I feel that my time was very well spent. Starting from my first day on the internship, I sat in and listened in on loan pipeline meetings, board of directors meetings, and various other meetings. I was also tasked with many kinds of jobs. From little jobs like printing out specific files to big jobs like needing to do the writeup for a loan, I was getting to work on various different skills throughout all these jobs such as, writing, critical thinking, listening, excel, PowerPoint, and even public speaking. When I first started, I mainly did the smaller jobs but after about two weeks in most of my time was spent working alongside multiple underwriters and watching/helping them underwrite their loans. Along with learning everything I was at the bank, I also had to attend conferences and seminars with my coworkers, and I got to meet a lot of smart people such as investors for our bank, a Houston congressman, various business owners, and many more. Getting to talk to all these people and different viewpoints allowed me to learn a lot of different things and I thought this was a very unique experience I got while working here. Over this semester I had a great time at this internship and I value the time I spent here. I was able to learn many things that I know will help me in the future no matter where I end up for work. I am also pleased to say I was offered a job if I want to take it once my internship has been completed. #UTDBSFIN #hireJSOM ', '\n\t\t\tPersonal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'For the past 2 semesters, I have had the amazing opportunity to work as a finance intern at Nanoscop ...', 'My internship experience at Emersons Commercial Real Estate was amazing!

Firstly, I realized the amount of impact technology can have on a companyâ€™s results and growth, as the technical tools used to guide customer satisfaction improvements were invaluable to the company. Secondly, I learned the importance of effective communication and presenting complex data in a concise and clear way. Lastly, I gained a deeper understanding of the role of a data analyst in a business environment.\nIn conclusion, my internship experience at Comfort Dental Braces was an enriching and rewarding experience.

Northern Compass is an IT business consulting firm that helps businesses solve significant challenges involving software, networks, security, communications, data, and design. I had the opportunity to learn about and develop applications in Front-end Development, Data Management, Backend Development (Server), and data. I did not have any professional working experience; however, this internship helped me gain technical skills and some professional experience. Throughout the internship period, I have gained much-needed knowledge and skills that I will be able to apply in my professional career after graduation. \n\tDuring the internship, I worked closely with the director of Northern Compass, discussing organization needs and completing my assigned duties. The supervisor asked me about SQL Server Management Studio and Visual Studio tools, where I applied the knowledge and skills I learned at The University of Texas at Dallas. While exploring SQL Server Management Studio, I learned how to create new databases, users, and roles and run queries for my project for my training. I wrote SQL Server scripts, ran queries, and created databases using SQL Server Management Studio. I have also previously connected to SQL Database instances, including ones that allow creating or modifying tables, indexes, and schemas. When I was learning and testing some queries for my SQL Server Management Studio Project, I had a few errors called syntax errors and keyword errors, and I learned how to resolve them. I checked the errors to see if the commands and clauses were misspelled and the use of the wrong quotation marks. I would also use a different arrangement of keywords, which can cause an issue. I also noted errors and informed my supervisor about them. I have also done front-end and UX designs for my project using Figma software to create and approve the design of a web page or mobile application design. I had to use Figma software for designing prototypes and building solutions. I learned how to build mobile applications, websites, and desktops as a result of the training provided by my supervisor. The work was done through multiple weekly virtual meetings when my supervisor assigned projects and discussed essential business decisions with fellow interns of this company and me.\n       The internship was a terrific learning opportunity, thanks to my supervisor. He took the time to teach me so much despite having a lot of expertise in his area. I am happy that I broadened my knowledge and abilities and had an excellent professional working experience. He showed me how to leverage my past experiences for the future, which I am eager to accomplish. \n#UTDBSITS #JSOMINTERN #JSOM ', '\n\t\t\tJSOM Email Newsletter\t\t\t', 'Bank of Montreal is the first Canadian bank founded in Montreal in 1817.

You should never stop inquiring. Let your curiosity's limit be open to expansion. Knowing more will make you more logical. The more you develop, the stronger your conviction.\n2. Share your errors and take a lesson from those of others. This prevents some errors from being made again by the team as a whole and is crucial for vertical growth.\n3. There is an onslaught of things demanding your attention, therefore you need to prioritize your duties, make a schedule, and have a visual list of what needs to be done. \n4.

The past 11 months have been a great learning curve for me, and I owe it all to the amazing team at DZS Inc. \nI have been a part of DZS since Summer 2022 and have continued my internship for the last two semesters of my masterâ€™s degree. I am grateful for this opportunity and would love to share my experience in this essay. \nI first started working with two major pillars of DZS products supporting the product scheduling, product lifecycle management, and phase approvals. Over the course of this semester, I jumped in-depth on applications like Smartsheets, Confluence, JIRA, Power Automate, MS Project, and Salesforce. I also worked with Oracle Cloud and made training materials for the project management office on change orders. I held training sessions for Confluence for my team in Korea during the month of December and January so that we can shift all information for each product on this platform. \nOne thing that made me hone my skills better and get in the position to work as a project manager was managing my own products since February. I am now managing two different product pillars, which included 3 major programs and over 12-15 products in different releases. Since DZS does both hardware and software products, this was a great learning opportunity for me to get to know about product management in both these domains. During this time, I worked very closely with the Research and Development team, Manufacturing and Operations teams, and the PMO Office. Managing these two pillars meant conducting weekly phase status meetings (cross-functional teams), scheduling milestones and product releases, inter-team and intra-team communication on progress, maintaining up-to-date documents and files, and facing any challenges along the way and creating coping strategies. \nApart from this, I have also been working toward the product lifecycle management automation by integrating automation in phase 0 and phase 1 requests and their approvals. \nMy experience in the last couple months helped me work as a project manager, implement agile methodologies, and be responsible for my own products. \nAs exciting and fun time it has been with DZS for the last 11 months, I now look forward to my next career step. This is a really thrilling time as I am to graduate in May and am in the process of figuring out whatâ€™s next for me. I know that my experience with DZS is going to be the backbone of what I do next, which makes me very grateful for this journey with them.\n#UTDMSMSC #hireJSOM #UTD ', '\n\t\t\tJSOM Handshake\t\t\t', 'I am thrilled to share my experience as a Marketing Intern at Shreeya Hospitality LLC.

The approach for the projects would be crowd-sourced freelance project management. Depending on the requirements of the project, CrowdPlat creates and manages a team of freelancers. The strategy is distinctive because it places a project manager in between the company and the freelancers. The customer can delegate their recruiting needs to the CrowdPlat employees by using the staffing solution. For companies like NASA, Greyhound, EPRI, ACT, and the City of Palo Alto, CrowdPlat has a track record of delivering effective company technology solutions.\nI am a graduate student at The University of Texas at Dallas, pursuing my masterâ€™s in Information Technology and Management. I had the chance to lead the projects as a Project Manager Intern while coordinating and collaborating with multiple clients and technical freelancers. I interacted with clients to better understand their requirements for the project, worked with the team to internally create a proposal for the client, and then assisted the technical team in completing the project. I led team meetings to brainstorm, report progress, and solicit feedback while working on these projects. I also conducted weekly meetings to refine the problem statement and comprehend stakeholder requirements. I also used Project Management tools such as Smartsheets and JIRA to keep track of the tasks and status updates.\nIn addition to the projects, I had the chance to participate in interview calls for a few developers, which helped me be more confident and provided me a chance to speak with diverse candidates. I have got the chance to create dashboards for clients, giving them better and easier to understand visualizations that aid in understanding the progress and the full relevance and context of a particular milestone.\nThrough the internship, I had the chance to put my master's program knowledge and skills to use in the real world while also honing my technical and communication skills. Even though the internship was remote, our team interacted in daily sprint meetings to go over developments and share personal and professional accomplishments.\nI enjoyed meeting new people along the way, learning about their positions within the organization, and sharing my weekly progress with my manager.

I juggled being a full time student and intern. This would not have been possible without the immense support of my Manager Francisco Fernandez and the amazing team.\nSome of my key takeaways from this internship are\n1.Be curious. Have an appetite to learn how things work. Ask those questions even if they sound silly in your head. I asked what was insourcing on my Day 1.\n2.Priortize your tasks. A ton of things will call for your attention, but clear your head and list your top 3 for the day or week. Align your tasks with the Team's priorities to leave a lasting impact. Work on them consistently.\n3.Focus on the big picture. You are always working with various stakeholders who have multiple asks. But setting your sight on the big picture helps with clarity.\n4.Collaborate and share your learnings. As someone who worked on both energy and vehicle programs, this helped me  identify systems that could be horizontally deployed.\n5.Have fun with what you are doing. Often times your Plan A doesn't work, so get creative and find a way to get the job done. It helps if you are flexible.\n6.Forge those relationships. Empathy is your superpower. This one is my favorite. For a very long time I felt empathy was my vulnerability, but to my surprise it emerged to be one of my strongest assets that got things done without burning bridges.

I learned how to problem-solve and think critically by documenting alarms, detailing the time and status of the issue, and escalating the problems to the correct on-call personnel.\nOne of the most difficult parts of the internship was taking calls and talking directly to the clients because I get anxious about not having the same level of experience as my coworkers who were knowledgeable about the issues we cover for the client.

I was able to gain valuable experience applying the skills I learned through my MSBA degree at UTD as well as gain insight into what an Advanced Analytics role looks like day to day at ONCOR.\nOne of the things I appreciated most about interning at Oncor was that it didnâ€™t feel like an internship at all. Rather, it felt like I was a part of the Advanced Analytics team just like anyone else. I shared similar responsibilities to those on my team in full-time roles such as owning the development of the project code, presenting updates to team members and management on the projects progress and performance, and meeting with stakeholders to understand their needs for each of the projects I was responsible for. I respected the high level of autonomy and responsibility Oncor gave me as an intern which I believe has translated into me gaining an incredible amount of real-world experience for this type of career.\nThere were two main projects that I was responsible for developing and reporting on during my internship. The first was to develop a forecasting model to predict energy consumption for premises better than the current model. I was able to develop and tune a model that drastically improved the prediction accuracy relative to the current model that will likely be going into production soon. The second was to create an automated process that would reduce the amount of billing exception cases that needed to be reviewed. I was able to develop a process that reduced these cases by 75% while virtually eliminating any false negatives. I enjoyed being responsible for these projects through their different stages of development and seeing the positive impact that they had for Oncor. \nLastly, I appreciated all the people I worked with and the relationships I was able to build. Everyone was very supportive and helpful whenever I would reach out. As stated before, no one ever made me feel like an intern but rather a member of the Advanced Analytics team. I also felt that my manager and team lead made it a point to get to know my goals and give me the necessary exposure to projects and tasks that would align with where I saw my career going. \nIn summary, I thoroughly enjoyed my time interning at Oncor as a member of the Advanced Analytics team.

Taking responsibility for your work and actions, be it big or small, makes a difference. My team has been very supportive of recognizing and appreciating my work, which in return has always motivated me to do better.\n2.      Curiosity takes you a long way. Every question answered sets the base for success and progress. Having an understanding about what we are trying to achieve helps in getting the right resources to do so. Ask all those questions!\n3.      Organizing is the key to having the balance that is needed, time commitments on different projects can be challenging but with a plan and schedule, it can be done effortlessly.\n4.      You will make mistakes and you have got to learn from them. Clarify with others and pay attention while doing so to avoid redundancy.\n5.

With my previous experience in finance and accounting, along with my business analyst coursework, I was excited to apply my classroom knowledge to real-world scenarios and gain practical experience in the field.\nMy task was to analyze the revenue and cost associated with selling a product and build a profit margin model. Using the company's NetSuite database, I identified the data sources that related to the revenue and supply chains. I analyzed the cost drivers and linked the direct costs to revenue while allocating indirect costs using the cost driver. This enabled me to create a sales margin analysis dataset for each transaction across various dimensions.\nIn addition to the sales margin analysis, I also worked on several data visualization projects using Tableau. For instance, I created a dashboard that tracked the margin performance of different revenue channels, enabling the team to monitor operational actions that caused price/quantity changes and profit margin effects. In many situations, I observed that discounting prices increased sales quantity but reduced profit margin percentage, while the total profit margin increased.\nOne of the most rewarding experiences of my job was the opportunity to delve into business operations, understand the value chain, and transform actions into data. I also worked with different departments to collaborate and learn from their perspectives and analysis needs. This helped me create meaningful dashboards and datasets that made sense in decision-making.\nOverall, my financial business analysis job was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to apply my academic knowledge to practical situations, gain exposure to various tools and techniques, and develop my analytical and problem-solving skills. It reinforced my interest in business analysis and solidified my career goals.

Additionally, created pivot charts to illustrate the declining amounts of outstanding purchase orders to propel further improvements.\n5) Updated the on-hand inventory status of over 250 stock transfer parts based out of our Clonmel site in Ireland which again paved way for a better knowledge on the active parts and those that were to be scrapped.\nAdditionally, as part of continuous improvements I constantly audited the tableau reports of the master data health for various metrics like Safety Stocks, Lead time, Re-order point, Lot sizes etc., to drive more accurate signals in SAP.

During my time in this position, I learned essential technical skills in great demand in the market. One of the most important skills I learned was SQL, which is required for querying and modifying databases. I also received expertise in data visualization with Tableau, which enabled me to deliver my findings to stakeholders clearly and concisely. Excel was another data analysis application that became my go-to, where I improved my skills in using pivot tables, algorithms, and functions. The opportunity to work on actual initiatives that impacted the company's bottom line was one of the most satisfying aspects of this internship. For example, I worked on a project that required me to analyze customer data to find patterns and trends. After employing statistical approaches such as regression analysis to establish which elements were driving customer behavior, I presented my findings to the marketing team. As a result, the company's customer retention strategy improved, resulting in more significant revenue. I also worked on a project that involved supply chain optimization. \nI examined data to identify supply chain bottlenecks and inefficiencies and provided strategies to address these concerns. This project taught me the value of data-driven decision-making and how it can result in major changes in corporate operations. This internship helped me acquire various soft skills essential for success in any field, in addition to the technical abilities I gained. For example, I learned how to interact with colleagues and stakeholders successfully, present my findings clearly and simply, and collaborate in a team setting. In retrospect, I am thankful for the opportunity to serve as a Business Data Analyst Intern at RAVE. This internship gave me a window into data analytics and helped me appreciate how data influences business choices. It was also an opportunity to work on tough projects, use my technical skills, and grow professionally. Furthermore, this internship inspired me to pursue a career in data analytics. I now understand the skills and information needed for success in this career, and I am excited to keep studying and growing in this area. Finally, I strongly suggest the Business Data Analyst Internship to anyone interested in data and want hands-on experience in the industry. This internship will give you a strong technical foundation and the soft skills required for success in any job.  #UTDBSITS #JSOMINTERN #JSOM "", '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines), Personal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'Citigroup Incorporated or Citi is an American multinational investment bank and financial services c ...', 'I am very excited to share that I was given the opportunity to be part of a fantastic team of intern ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

I had prior experience as a Software Developer for almost 6 years when I decided to pursue my Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics at the University of Texas at Dallas. Having worked closely with big data previously, I was always intrigued by what else one can do with such vast information. Surely there is a lot of knowledge one can gain if the raw data is interpreted and analyzed accurately. It was this curiosity that led me to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics, to closely understand and interpret a clientâ€™s data and provide business solutions to an existing problem. During my Spring 2022 semester, I was introduced to Robotics Process Automation - a software technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage software robots that emulate human actions interacting with digital systems and software. Robotic process automation streamlines workflows, which makes organizations more profitable, flexible, and responsive. It also increases employee satisfaction, engagement, and productivity by removing mundane tasks from their workdays. This is when I was introduced to Appian, something that combined my experience and current educational pursuits perfectly.\nWorking as an Appian intern with Solomon Associates was a truly rewarding and inspirational journey. I was working under Mr. Randy Toombs, Senior Manager of Software Development. My role as an intern was to develop an Appian application to streamline and uplift an existing portal. Randy encouraged me to follow my instincts and challenge every discussion which I was part of. I was given the freedom to explore new ways of doing things and was given complete ownership of the project. The environment at Solomon is a perfect one for an employee to grow and achieve great things. Starting from my first day in the office till date, I have always been greeted with warm smiles and friendly behavior from everyone I interacted with. For an intern in a whole other country, these small things make him feel more at home and boost his confidence.\nI continued my internship from Fall of 2022 to Spring 2023, and it was a highly rewarding experience, to say the least. I was entrusted with much more responsibility, and I was accountable for my submitted work. I had become part of the family and clearly understood my roles and responsibilities.\nOne of the key takeaways from this internship for me was the work culture of a corporate business in the USA. It really does not matter what your social or ethnic background is, everyone is exposed to the same opportunities, and everyone is treated equally. Punctuality and work-life balance were some other valuable takeaways for me from this internship experience. I would like to take the opportunity to thank Mr. Randy Toombs and Mr. Satish Daatla for giving me this opportunity.

The key expectations of mine were to give an analysis of the companyâ€™s staffing data and provide reporting visualizations for business-related scenarios for a better understanding of the logic. I learned how crucial business domain knowledge is as my analysis should provide insights that a stakeholder or client can use to solve a business problem. I got this over time, with experience. Initially, I was only extracting information from data by creating dashboards. Later I started working on full-stack data science from data warehouse implementation for presenting my analysis to clients.\nMy internship was a whole sum of the learning experience. Besides being an intern, I was also continuing my course at the university, which implies I not only had client requests to work on, but I also had university assignments and tests to complete. Initially it was a hard nut to crack but I was very diligent in maintaining a balance between school and work by meeting all deadlines on time.\nAs a graduate student of Business Analytics at UTD, the coursework like Database foundations, Bigdata analytics, Data visualization, and Applied Machine learning helped me succeed in this internship.

My experience with Co-op as an internal audit data analyst has been enlightening in numerous aspects. I have had the privilege of working with multiple teams and gaining extensive business knowledge from experienced leaders. The team's dedication, enthusiasm, hard work, and collaborative spirit have been a pleasure to witness and be a part of.\nDuring my internship, I worked on an exciting project that involved creating a PowerBI dashboard using Audit Process Universe data. The dashboard provided real-time insights into the audit process, which helped identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions. One of the primary features of the dashboard was tracking mandatory and recommended controls tested, which made it easy to identify areas that required improvement. Additionally, the dashboard provided a consolidated risk overview, including risk count by rating and EMT, conversion of high and moderate risks to issues, and a detailed view of high-severity issues handled by EMT.\nAnother aspect of the project involved updating staff timecards monthly. We achieved this by automatically adding the latest data to the utilization calculation in the timecard data tab. This ensured that the staff timecards were up-to-date and the utilization calculation was accurate. Overall, working on this project was an enriching experience that helped me gain valuable data visualization, data analysis, and project management skills. Creating the PowerBI dashboard was a collaborative effort that involved working closely with my team members. We had to extract and consolidate data from different sources, transform it, and load it into the dashboard. We also had to ensure that the dashboard was easy to use and understand, so we spent a significant amount of time designing the layout and selecting appropriate visualizations.\nThroughout the project, I gained hands-on experience using PowerBI, and SQL and learned how to visualize complex data sets meaningfully. I also worked with different stakeholders, including auditors, risk managers, and IT professionals. The project also overcame several challenges, including data quality and design challenges. However, with the help of my team members and supervisor, we were able to address these challenges and deliver a high-quality dashboard that exceeded expectations.\nLooking back at my internship at Co-op during the Spring 23 semester, I take pride in my accomplishments while working with the Co-op team. My hands-on experience has equipped me with valuable skills and knowledge that will prove essential in achieving my future aspirations.

GBO introduced a new strategy in their demand planning initiative called Replenishment Planning. It primarily focuses on building up inventory without being dependent on the demand signal for future consumption. This strategy revolved around linearizing the signal being fed to the factories to produce the right amount of inventory for a given time frame or, as TI likes to call it, during â€œcycle time.â€ My first few days went on in training about the organization and some starter analytical tools to use that would equip me to do my day-to-day responsibilities. The subject spreadsheet modeling helped me with this through concepts like creating Pivot tables & data tables for analysis and reporting purposes. Apart from CHIP segmentations, I slowly transitioned into the start plans for various wafers, which made me dig deeper into specific CHIPS, look at their trend and forecast a target value required to attain max usage from that CHIP. My core responsibility focuses on the RP algorithm that uses to predict the actual target values for each CHIP. TIâ€™s Kilby lab designed it, but my job was to understand this algorithm and provide business cases that showed outliers in their algorithm. This is where business analytics with R, a subject from the second semester, helped me understand this concept and provide actual feedbacks to be delivered to IT to better their algorithm. Recently, I was assigned a project to work on building a dashboard to automate their segmentation changes on any of their material through SPOTFIRE, which allows me to add more skill set to my portfolio, and play a role in their growth. Working for the GBO team has allowed me to network with such brilliant people around the organization, and learning and grasping their advice augments my professional development every day.

It is very important to know your work and be really very good at it. Dont hesitate to reach out to your peers if you are stuck at your work. In my case, I am fortunate to work with exceptional peers like Vishal and Jonathan, who are always willing to lend their support when needed. Secondly, It is important to identify the common problems faced by your team and have ideas on how to address them. I am delighted that my manager, Anand, motivated the team to devise unconventional solutions to these issues. One such issue was how a new team member can solve the common data engineering issues faced by the team in general. As a result, I created an interactive Quora page for my team, enabling them to log their work-related questions and receive notifications when someone responds with an answer. That posted page will be public, and can be referred by anyone simply by searching for the error they are looking for.\nAdditionally, I demonstrated how to execute adhoc runs without CR (Change Request) approvals or CICD process by designing a Glue workflow diagram utilizing AWS state machines, and this idea was much appreciated as this idea can help team reduce their time during CR process for their adhoc runs and I was rewarded for this idea. Finally, networking with your peers and managers is vital. Building strong relationships and effective communication with them can open new opportunities and help you succeed.\n#UTDMSBA #vanguard #internship2022 ', '\n\t\t\tJSOM Handshake, JSOM on-campus interview\t\t\t', 'I have been interning with Crescent Bank since June 2022, and it has been a joyful, rich, and memora ...', 'My Graduate Internship at Tenaska Power Services was one of the most rewarding experiences I have ha ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

We worked on a SWOT analysis of multiple pain points community and regional banks face and formulated the opportunities into a new product architect.\nI also worked on a cloud market research task, which involved studying the cloud market trends and identifying potential cloud-based solutions that the company could offer to its customers. This assignment helped me better understand cloud technologies and their potential applications in the banking industry.\nI used Snowflake, a powerful data warehousing platform, to analyze my collected data. I completed all the Hands-On Essentials of Snowflake, which allowed me to develop expertise in this tool and use it to its fullest potential. Using this tool, I could generate new data, manipulate the existing data from the Snowflake marketplace, create different views, and eventually connect it to a visualization tool to make it appealing and get actionable insights.\nSpeaking about visualizing tools, I used Power BI to create two visually appealing and interactive dashboards that provided insights into my collected data. These allowed the company\'s executives to make informed decisions and improve their business operations. Training myself to learn DAX and Power Query while juggling the data between Snowflake and Excel helped me realize that data is complex yet fun. Looking at data from different personas is very important, and it enables you to make informed decisions on how you want to work with your data. \nI also worked on a new tool called power automate to extract data from the web. This is a fantastic tool to build workflows and automate your daily tasks. Playing around with this tool was fun and gave me different perspectives on how we can achieve multiple recurring functions at once without even doing them. Here, I learned what smart work is compared to hard work. One of the essential lessons I learned from my mentor Louis was, ""There is always a way to achieve things. All you need to do is approach the problem from a different perspective"".  \nFinally, last but definitely not least, I got my hands dirty on branding and designing logos. Throughout my career, I had multiple chances to switch domains, and I was never afraid to do so because I always looked upon the bright side and that ""Learning"". Overall, my internship was a fantastic learning experience that allowed me to develop various skills and gain valuable experience from industry leaders.

I also monitor previously made data pipelines to ensure that the correct data is being ingested into the source.\nDuring my time at Citi, I had the opportunity to work on multiple projects. Some were in data engineering, data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. Each of the projects I worked on was a learning experience for me. The projects were curated in a way that allowed me to gain experience in the different types of data operations that were going on at Citi.\nFor data engineering, I was assigned to add new columns to a pre-existing marketing table. Even though it sounds simple, testing to make sure that the data was ingested correctly was time-consuming. My next project consisted of me doing data analysis and data visualizations over five important financial datasets that the department I work with maintains. The final data aspect I was assigned was a machine learning use case. Using one of the datasets from my data analysis part, I was assigned to predict three months of sales forecasting. The following projects helped me get better at Spark, SQL, Python. It also helped me learn new technologies such as Snowflake.\nThe projects were just a scratch of my Citi experience, since my start date I have met many great people. These people made long lasting impact on me, they have guided me through projects or gave me life advice. My experience wouldnâ€™t be the same without them.

As a tactical solution intern, I worked on a range of projects to support FHLB's objectives while refining my skills. Through my work with data, I gained insight into how businesses operate, and my internship experience can be summarized as follows:\nDuring my spring internship, I honed my skills in SQL, report building, and Excel, as well as learning a new language called M query. These languages and tools became second nature to me, and I used them to derive value for FHLB. While I worked on several assignments, three projects stood out.\nFirst, I helped identify data and logic issues to streamline the company's data migration objective. This project allowed me to improve my SQL skills and extract the right information through complex queries. Additionally, working with different business departments improved my business and financial acumen while enhancing my communication skills as I acted as a liaison between IT and other business units. This project introduced me to Power Query, which enabled me to analyze data right from within Excel and seamlessly connect to a range of external data sources. As a result, I could create reconciliation reports to test stories that were pushed back due to migration issues or code changes. I also learned about scrum and how to create tickets for operational effieciency.\nSecondly, I automated documents for one of the business departments using Adobe Sign, where I recreated the form and used naming conventions to map the document to a database.\nNo alt text provided for this image\nThird, I participated in various activities organized by the company, such as wellness classes and time management classes, to develop my soft skills. I am eager to take on additional responsibilities, such as joining Toastmasters or the BUILD program, to enhance my creativity and communication skills.\nWorking at FHLB felt like learning outside of the classroom, with mentors who provided different perspectives on the same problem to broaden my approach to addressing it.

In applying these concepts to develop the handling of the acquisition and process for which consumers would achieve customized mortgage loans for both purchase and refinance transactions.\n\tA customized processing data center was developed using VBA coding and analysis tools. Consumer loans would be entered with pertinent information and tasks that typically would be manually handled were either streamlined or automated for increased efficiency. Emails for items needed internal /external notifications and standard communications were custom built to be sent at the click of a button. The processing suite was developed in conjunction with management input to ensure end user/key stakeholder approval and reduce rework or rejection by external parties. Ultimately, the original processing speeds for tasks were reduced by 20%, which among peer benchmarks kept the company competitive. However, based on future projections of use, the same tasks at full scale should result in an overall efficiency increase of 35% compared to peers, which would be the equivalent to 1.5 hours per day of loan processing. This could yield an additional 2.5 loans per month towards revenue.\n\tSimultaneously, while looking for methods to increase internal efficiencies, a database CRM was built from scratch to integrate with an existing POS and communication software being utilized by the company. The database, while still new, currently houses information for over 6,500 consumers among which previous engagement was less than 3%. This was largely the result of impersonal marketing and perceived automation of attempts to reach out. However, with the development of the database, with the POS and communication software, we were able to build more targeted marketing and newsletter style emails to engage with consumers. Initial results are approximately 5% contact rate, with a hope in 90 days to grow to 7%. As a relatively new company, the ability to meet peer benchmarks and have capacity to expand into greater efficiencies helps ensure continued growth among a unpredictable mortgage lending market. #UTDMSSCM #hireJSOM #mortgagelender #opportunity #success ', '\n\t\t\tPersonal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', ""As I approach the completion of my Master's degree in Supply Chain Management, I want to take a mome ..."", 'My Spring-2023 internship experience at Tesla Inc.\nAs I reach into the final week of my Sprin ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

In a different project, I used Pentaho to implement an ETL process flow that helped the user eliminate repetitive manual tasks. I get to learn about the automotive industry while assisting the stakeholders in prioritizing the requests and presenting solutions while working with many additional ad hoc analyses. Occasionally, taking responsibility for the work and focusing on problem-solving assisted me in developing personally and professionally.\nI developed my critical thinking abilities throughout the internship while also honing my technical knowledge of SQL, GCP BigQuery, and Tableau. My career in the US began with this as a solid base. With the knowledge and experience I\'ve gained from my internship, I\'m delighted to provide value and hope to use what I\'ve learned in the future.\n#UTDMSBA #JSOM #SPRING2023 ', '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines), Personal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'I have been interning with Crescent Bank since June 2022, and it has been a joyful, rich, and memora ...', 'My Graduate Internship at Tenaska Power Services was one of the most rewarding experiences I have ha ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

Through these experiences, I gained valuable insights into the auto finance business and the tools used for data analytics-related tasks.\nLet me begin by introducing Tricolor Holdings' mission: Empowering Hispanic Consumers to Achieve the American Dream. Tricolor is a mission-driven organization that provides clients with access to inexpensive financing on certified vehicles in order to improve their quality of life and increase the credit scores of the underbanked population, particularly the Hispanic community. With tremendous mission and greater risks comes great responsibility. Our risk and strategy development division is critical in this regard. I was hired as a Data Science intern to manage various credit risk-related and strategic projects using analytical and data-driven methodologies.\nOne of the projects I worked on involved marketing analysis. Using Python functions and geo codes, we were able to gather information on competitors within a 10-mile radius of each Tricolor lot and % of Hispanic community population. This helped us to better understand how our competitors were performing and to identify areas where we could scale up our marketing activities. We used Python web scraping tools such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium to extract relevant data.\nAnother project was grade change analysis. To prevent customer dissatisfaction with initial grades being downgraded, we used SQL JSON query extraction and Python custom functions to determine when to assign grades.\nIn addition to marketing analysis and grade change analysis, I also worked on policy tracking. I found it intriguing to see how machine learning algorithms were used to segment customers based on their profiles and how the results were regulated by various policies. By tracking the policies and performance of customer segments within each policy, we were able to govern the underwriting process. We used complex SQL queries and data modeling, and then visualized the data in Power BI.\nThroughout the internship, I appreciated the support and guidance provided by my manager, Samarth Shah, and the mentoring I received from Aanchal Jalan and Sunil Aleti. Their daily guidance was extremely helpful, and I learned a great deal from their discussions on the current market situation and how Tricolor Holdings prepares for and navigates economic risks.\nIn conclusion, my Data Science Internship at Tricolor Holdings was a great learning experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to work with such a talented team. Additionally, the mentoring provided by my manager and colleagues was invaluable, and I am confident that the skills I gained during this internship will serve me well in my future career endeavors.\n#UTDMSBA "", '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines), Personal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'I have been interning with Crescent Bank since June 2022, and it has been a joyful, rich, and memora ...', 'My Graduate Internship at Tenaska Power Services was one of the most rewarding experiences I have ha ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

An independent member of Baker Tilly International (BTI), Baker Tilly US (BT US) aims to create the advisory CPA firm of the future. For two consecutive years, BT US has ranked in the top 10 of Inside Public Accounting's ranking of the largest public accounting firms by net revenues. Moreover, of the top 100 firms on Inside's 2022 rankings, BT US ranked as the sixth fastest growing firm. Although this growth impressed me, I was most impressed by the culture that became evident very early on in my internship. Baker Tilly's culture is driven by its core values: collaboration, integrity, passion, stewardship, and belonging.\nAs an audit intern, I had the opportunity to work alongside numerous BT team members on GAAS financial statement audits with most of my job duties pertaining to the cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, operating expense, and revenue sections of the audits. Going into my first busy season, I was expecting to feel like I had been thrown into the deep end so-to-speak once the busy season hit. Fortunately, it never felt like that. While there was a huge learning curve, I was surrounded by some great team members who were always willing to help. Admittedly, when I first started I felt like I was annoying my teams with the amount of questions I asked, but over time I became far more comfortable reaching out to my teams. Each time I reached out for help, everyone was patient, respectful, and took their time to provide thorough explanations. Looking back on my experience, I surprised myself with my development over the course of just a few months, especially in regards to my technical skills.\nLastly I'm excited to announce that yesterday, I officially accepted an offer to return as a full-time associate in January 2024. Special thanks to Baker Tilly recruiter, Madison Meade, my coach/mentor, Tim Sage, CPA, and my buddy/mentor, Graham Nance. I'd also like to thank UTD alumni and BT audit associate, Caroline Dillard for taking time out of her day to get a picture with me in front of the BT logo (above).

This experience was important for me to acquire before taking on any upcoming roles as a junior analyst or engineer.\nMy time at Vanguard gave me a substantial amount of expertise with Python and big data technologies such as PySpark and Hadoop. I was able to apply the concepts I learned in college in a corporate setting, which was a goal of mine. Helping my colleagues with various types of data and assisting them with projects gave me a great sense of satisfaction.\nI am grateful for the approachable and supportive team who served as my mentors throughout the internship and gave me several tasks.

It provides opportunities for academic, personal, and professional development through internships and studies abroad programs. GlobalEd provides internships to university students and recent Graduates seeking internships by partnering with various companies to provide consultations in various fields to these companies. \n       After applying to GlobalEd abroad for an IT internship, I was accepted to the program as an IT and analytics Consultant in January 2023. I was excited about the opportunity. It made the opportunity even more interesting because it was my last semester at UT Dallas. \n     The project I was part of was a CRM optimization and automation project for Trees for Needs, a company that is a partner with GlobalEd Abroad. The tasks I was given was, to work in collaboration with my team to build solutions to clean and optimize the CRM to make it more efficient, automate some process within and around the CRM, and analyze which version of ACT! CRM would be more efficient. In addition to that, I was tasked to build reports and templates and generate insights. \n      At first, it was a bit overwhelming because I had no prior experience with CRMs and have never heard of ACT! CRM. I thought I might not fully understand and learn the platform in time to make a meaningful contribution. But it took less than two weeks to establish a strong foundational knowledge about CRMs and learn ACT! CRM. \n      While working on the project, in addition to getting real exposure to a CRM, I gained various new skills. One of the skills that I learned was the optimization of CRMs according to business needs. Another skill is building reports and reporting templates that help track KPIs for a business. \n       I had great things happen while interning at GlobalEd Abroad. One of them was getting to meet the President/CEO of Trees for Needs, the Company we were consulting. I was also able to have multiple meetings with upper management from their company and was able to interview their vendor to gather information to build insights. I also got promoted to Project Manager, less than two months after starting as an intern. I was caught off guard and excited by the opportunity but also thankful that I was promoted to PM. It boosted my confidence and pushed me, even more, to be creative and invested in the project. As a PM I learned how to work with team members by navigating through their work patterns to build an effective work schedule to finish our deliverables on time. \n          Throughout the internship, week in and week out new challenges and problems were waiting to be solved.

For example, during the internship, one of my projects was researching the utilities sector, which forced me to read a lot of information about this industry. I learned where to find professional M&A reports and how to utilize major transactions to analyze market trends. Also, this was the first time I worked with a very complicated financial model, which inspired me in how to build a reasonable financial model.\nOverall, this was a great experience for me and encouraged me to have more passion about my future career.\n#UTDBSFIN #hireJSOM ', '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines), Personal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'For the past 2 semesters, I have had the amazing opportunity to work as a finance intern at Nanoscop ...', 'My internship experience at Emersons Commercial Real Estate was amazing!

I was fortunate enough this spring to get an opportunity to work with o9 Solutions, Inc. as a Functional Consultant Intern in the Customer Success Team.\nHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas, o9 Solutions, Inc. leverages its Digital â€œSupply Chain Knowledge Graph,â€ which monitors demand and supply signals in real-time, detects problems early and drives automated demand and supply shaping decisions with an intelligent evaluation of resolution options.\nWorking on Cutting-edge technology like R, Python, and Advanced SQL and applying them to the Supply Chain Management domain was the best learning experience throughout my internship. This Internship also taught me various concepts like Supply chain master planning, demand planning, and demand forecasting. I configured multiple features on the o9 platform, which helped the client reduce the number of help tickets with maximum efficiency deployed on the production. I was lucky enough to interact with our customers. This experience presented a unique opportunity to learn, make mistakes, and re-learn in a high-pressure environment. The pressure allowed us to test our limits, discover our strengths, develop them, and curb our weaknesses.\nBeing in an environment with the best and brightest across the country, knowing your strengths, and projecting them are vital to being a star. However, it takes a lot more to be a superstar.\nThe value of a graduate internship cannot be over-emphasized. It broadens your horizon, deepens your connections, and keys you into a state of mind that most graduates struggle to transition into after their studies. Getting a good grade is just the first step; the corporate world is another ball game entirely.\nLast but not least, grateful to my fellow o9ers and interns who made this journey enjoyable!\n#utdmsitm #o9solutions #o9er ', '\n\t\t\tPersonal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'During my internship at Technosoft Corporation, I was assigned to work on a government-based project ...', 'Greetings everyone!!\n\nI am extremely happy and grateful to have received internship of ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

So, I am going to provide a brief overall story of how it came about and a few\ntakeaways I learned while at WSB.\nWSB is a consulting and design company that offers construction services, which is why I was excited by\nthe opportunity to come aboard. I have grown up in the construction world my whole life and I am\ngrateful to have the opportunity to leverage what I have learned about business intelligence and\nanalytics in this industry. I was presented with an opportunity to be part of a team that will develop a\nnew business group that has the potential to change project delivery and management for the\nconstruction industryâ€”it was a no brainer to jump at the chance to help in any way I could.\nNow for a few takeaways from the experience:\n1. Working on something completely new is exciting and very difficult.\nThe â€œwinsâ€ seem to come faster when you know exactly what you must do to succeed every\nday. When the path is not clear, the â€œwinsâ€ come slower and are not always obvious. However,\nthe process is a rewarding one because you learn a good deal more than you might see in the\nmoment.\n2. What is on your resume may not be what you end up doing.\nWhen starting a new venture, the job must get done and when resources are tightâ€”you just\nmight end up doing a whole lot more than you bargained for. Any opportunity to take on more\nresponsibility is something to be thankful for.\n3. Donâ€™t stop learning and being creative.\nIt is very important to listen before you speak, but there is a time when you need to take the risk\nand show others what you can do. The internship gave me many opportunities to test my\ntechnical ability but also my ability to think outside the box.\nOverall, I am thankful WSB gave me the opportunity to be part of their new venture and I am excited for\nwhat lies before me post-graduation.\n#UTDMSMSC #hireJSOM ', '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines), Personal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'I am thrilled to share my experience as a Marketing Intern at Shreeya Hospitality LLC.

Before this, I had little to no knowledge about these topics, but I am proficient to a certain degree after this internship. \n           The best part about my internship was not what I learned but the people I met. It was interesting meeting people from backgrounds and cultures. I learned about and from them, and I hope they also learned a lot from me. \n           Overall, the internship was a great experience. I learned a lot and met a lot of great people.

It primarily provides its clients with assurance, tax, consulting, and advisory services. EY operates as a network of member firms structured as separate legal entities in a partnership, with 312,250 employees in over 700 offices in more than 150 countries worldwide. \nDuring the internship, I learned a lot of skills and gained some valuable experience. First of all, after interning at EY, I learned a lot of shortcuts, functions, and formulas. I can fix many problems through Excel more quickly than before. In addition, I learned how to respond to client requests faster and more professionally by email. Furthermore, I gained the skill of maintaining productive working relationships with client personnel. Finally, I learned to cooperate with team members to accomplish goals effectively and efficiently.\nThe internship experience aligned with my career goals. My career goals are to work in an accounting firm as an auditor. One day when I get the CPA license and accumulate abundant experience, I would like to become a partner in an accounting firm. As a result, being an intern in an audit service line is a tiny step, but it is an essential cornerstone for me and my career goals. \nThrough this internship experience, I acquired lots of valuable experience. Especially, I interned during the busy season. Therefore, I needed to work overtime sometimes, and there was a lot of work during the busy season. I experienced the most realistic auditor life during the period of internship. It was an exciting and challenging experience. When all of the things came out together and were close to the due date, how I adjusted my mind, balanced work and life, and enhanced the effectiveness and efficiency of work. In conclusion, I am glad I had the chance to intern at EY. This experience would let me make progress and is helpful and valuable.\n#UTDMSACCT ', '\n\t\t\tJSOM Handshake\t\t\t', 'From working as a Financial Analyst at JLL for almost one year now, I was able to gain the experienc ...', 'As my internship at CCK Strategies, PLLC came to an end, I reflected on my own experiences and gaine ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

During my time there, I worked as a tax intern for 3 months, where I was responsible for preparing and analyzing tax returns, conducting tax research, and assisting with tax planning strategies.\nOne of the key takeaways from my internship was the importance of attention to detail. As a tax analyst, even the slightest error in a tax return could have significant consequences for the client. This made me realize that attention to detail is not just important in the tax industry but in every aspect of life. I learned to double and triple check my work to ensure that I did not make any mistakes.\nAnother important lesson I learned was the importance of communication skills. As an intern, I had the opportunity to work with people at all levels of the organization, from other interns to senior tax professionals. I found that effective communication was crucial in building relationships and getting work done efficiently. I learned to listen carefully, ask questions, and communicate my thoughts clearly and concisely.\nDuring my internship, I had the opportunity to work on various tax projects and apply what I have learnt from Financial and tax accounting classes to real business practices. One of the most rewarding experiences was assisting a small business owner in reducing their tax liability. This required a deep understanding of the tax code and creative thinking to come up with a tax planning strategy that worked for the client.\nLastly, I had a few opportunities to meet several partners of the company who had started their career as an intern, just like me. They shared their career journey and the valuable lessons they learned along the way. This made me realize that every experience, no matter how small, can have a significant impact on one's career path.\nOverall, my internship experience as a tax intern taught me important life lessons, improved my attention to detail, communication skills, and introduced me to valuable professionals in the industry. I am grateful for this experience and look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I gained to my future endeavors. #UTDMSACCT "", '\n\t\t\tJSOM career event\t\t\t', 'From working as a Financial Analyst at JLL for almost one year now, I was able to gain the experienc ...', 'EY is one of the largest professional services networks in the world.

Despite this, my managers, Lauren Wood and Kayla Rodriguez, made an effort to contact the individuals I had requested so that I could schedule meetings with them. I was able to meet with a senior associate, senior manager, and two partners monthly. It was truly exceptional, and I cannot express my gratitude enough to these four individuals for providing me with great insights into the accounting industry and valuable career advice.\nAll interns were given an excellent opportunity to participate in an industry expo where we learned about international tax, state & local tax, investment funds, and more. We were given the chance to work with these industries, and I chose investment funds, which was an incredible experience. \nThrough this company, I was also able to attend two remarkable events with the North Dallas Chamber of Commerce. I had the privilege of hearing Dr. Brian Tyler of McKesson and Lee Bratcher of Texas Blockchain provide meaningful insight into the direction of their industries, advice on career progression, and how to make oneself a more valuable individual.\nI cannot thank Weaver enough for all the resources that it has provided me.

Using GIS technology to analyze the demographics of a potential site and negotiate terms on behalf of a client makes opening up practices stress-free and simple for future doctors and owners. \nDespite already being a full-time student as well as a part-time client advisor at Louis Vuitton, I wanted to pursue an interest that I always had as a business-oriented person. I applied to the Xite sales internship program when I noticed an opening for a position in their company that involves work with real estate. Though my experience working in such an industry has been limited, I had always envisioned my future with some aspect of real estate. At the very least, I wanted to gain a real-world grasp of how markets and economies work in such a large field. Having filled out the application, I made my way to their offices; eager to introduce myself. Once introductions were made, the team offered me the position on the spot, as Xite is keen on individuals that like to chase any and all opportunities. The following months would exemplify that rule to me in a very strong manner.\nHaving multiple deals and clients to manage, the workload never seemed to drop off at any point. However, I was happy with how many projects I could help on and pick up any pieces of knowledge that I could while working on my assignments. The office culture truly has a â€œgo-get-themâ€ attitude toward their projects. A glimpse at anyone's schedule would feature a mass of colorful blocks sectioned into meetings (both virtual and in-person) or tasks to complete.\nSeeing as how I wasnâ€™t licensed as an agent yet, I could only help around with the background and setup for these meetings. Whether it was amassing potential sites for a medical practice or running comparison reports for which sites were the best fit for a client, I slowly grew comfortable with working on multiple software and templates for the company.\nMy experience with Xite Realty is one that I look upon fondly. Being able to learn some rare background knowledge from industry veterans while also being able to improve my own skills and workflow proved to be a great investment for my future growth.

I got the opportunity to work with great mentors that taught me many experiences. I also got the opportunity to experience challenges that you see in delayed work.  \nPrior to my internship, I was working at the company for 6 months so I was able to use my work as my internship. From the start of my internship experience, I was able to work on a project in which the company was investing in crypto machines. Some of my responsibilities were talking to customers, selling them the different types of machines, then mining while I set the customerâ€™s account on a website called Antpool. Antpool kept track of how much money they are making. I was able to learned that every job comes with some challenges and important lessons.  When I first begin the project, I was in the learning process and one day my manager was out of town and We were a lot behind schedule. I took on a leadership role and decide that I learned enough to start without Chris being there. I started working on mining the machines but I missed up and assigned the wrong machine to the wrong client because I missed a step in the process. I notice the problem and I stopped working on it until he came back. When my manger arrived , I told him What happened. He immediately hosted a meeting with the team. To be honest I was nervous because he was going to call me out in front of the team and be upset. During the meeting, he actually comments on how great job I have been doing. He really liked that I took on a leadership role when he was not there. He mentioned in the meeting is that we all miss up every now and then including him. Its all about what we learn from it and move on not do it again. \nOverall my internship experience taught me many things, I learned that is very important to write down everything and ask questions before you start something especially early in the project. My mentor was very calm and showed me where I made the mistake and comforted me and encouraged me to do my best, It was very rewarding learning from my mentor as well as figuring out the mistake on my own.

During this time, I have gained valuable experience in design and front-end development. I was able to apply my knowledge to real world business examples and receive a much deeper understanding of how to create visually appealing and functional designs that focus on end user needs. In addition to my work in design, I also began learning XAML which gives me exposure to another aspect of front-end development, allowing me to expand beyond just HTML and CSS.\nOne of the things that made my experience at Northern Compass particularly enjoyable was the support and guidance I received from my mentor there. They were always willing to share their immense knowledge and expertise of the industry with me. With their encouragement, I was able to fully realize my passion for front-end development and design. They inspired me to push myself further than ever before, strive for excellence in my work, and they motivated me to begin pursuing a UX certificate, which will be a great addition to my skill set.\nA key project that I worked on during this internship was creating a customized mobile application prototype for a small business. This project required me to understand the businessâ€™s needs, functions, and preferences, as well as create designs that were attractive and cohesive. This helped me develop my skills with Adobe XD and Figma, design tools widely used in the industry for UI and UX designs.\nOverall, my internship this semester with Northern Compass was extremely rewarding. I gained countless insights into the industry and extremely valuable experience actually working in it.

I was able to learn new skills that have helped me develop professionally, as well as taught me more about who I am as a person. \nAcquiring new skills is a valuable part of taking on new projects and experiences, which is why I took advantage of any opportunities that came my way. For example, I received hands-on experience with utilizing Microsoft Power BI for the first time due to most reports being created by this software. This required research on my end to learn how to navigate the software so that I can accurately read the visuals presented to me, as well as learn how to manipulate filters and slicers to get the data I want to see. I practiced how to load data and run SQL queries in the software so that I could design visuals that tell a story. I was even given the chance to create a dashboard for a project! \nIn addition to learning about a new software, I learned more about myself. When approaching problems, I tend to think of solutions that are generic to what I usually do for similar situations. Working with others has taught me to view things in different perspectives. This has expanded my strategic thinking skills as well as taught me that I am more flexible that I thought I was when it comes to tackling obstacles in my way.\nI am grateful for my experience at UTSW, and I cannot wait to see what else is in store for the future.

I was thrown in a pool of opportunities to learn and practice something new every day, which made the whole experience extremely fulfilling.\nThe New York Times doesn't need an introduction, but to brief about my work, I have been recruited by its Application Security Team, so the team's goal is to secure all applications developed and used in the organization. I was involved in all their daily tasks, providing ample opportunities to explore real security issues and learn from them.\nI don't want to get into a lot of technicalities of my job at The Times, but I would say I have got to get my hand dirty in a lot of different tasks, and my team was super supportive of involving me and guiding me through every new job the intern was curios to take. I could not have asked for a better manager than @Nick and a better team than #AppSec.\nThis was my third semester interning with the Times, and it has challenged me well every moment to learn something new, improving my technical and interpersonal skills. There was never a blah moment in the cybersecurity team at the Times.\nThe team I worked with was remote, but it never felt like a barrier. Everyone was just a ping away and always ready to help. I was encouraged throughout to take ownership and guided decisions, which greatly boosted my confidence. The positive and supportive attitude of my manager @seble and team members Mary DuBard, Alex made the whole learning experience super fun. I cherish each day I have spent here and would not have asked for a better launchpad than this.\n Lastly, I would also like to thank The University of Texas at Dallas for refining my skills and providing an excellent internship platform.\n#hirejsom #utdmsitm "", '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines)\t\t\t', 'During my internship at Technosoft Corporation, I was assigned to work on a government-based project ...', 'Greetings everyone!!\n\nI am extremely happy and grateful to have received internship of ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

As a leading consulting firm specializing in IAM strategy, research, requirements, design, and implementation of Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, Idenhaus Consulting has received numerous accolades for its work in identity management and cybersecurity. I am grateful for the opportunity to continue my internship with them throughout the Summer of 2022 until the Spring of 2023.\nDuring my 13-week Spring internship, I had the opportunity to work with clients in the business and educational sectors, and I also had the chance to help the organization onboard a new cybersecurity intern. The staff at Idenhaus Consulting has been incredibly helpful and kind throughout my internship, and I cannot express my gratitude enough. One of the standout features of the company\'s culture is its collaborative nature, which provided me with the opportunity to work with and learn from a variety of professionals in the cybersecurity field.\nThroughout my internship, I received training on how to conduct GAP analyses and new assessment techniques. I gained a deep understanding of the business practices of SMBs and assisted a customer in developing an IAM strategy to define a phase implementation path that maximized value and minimized implementation risk. Additionally, I supported the establishment of security assessments for clients who were operating remotely due to the pandemic. I also had the opportunity to research cutting-edge technology that could be used to address client problems. One of my proudest accomplishments during my internship was writing a blog post titled ""Policy vs Standards vs Procedures,"" which was posted on the corporate website. This post outlines how to ensure that individuals and employees within any organization use technology in the way that the organization intends.\nIn addition, I had the pleasure of attending meetings with clients and helping them finish their document and presentation deliverables. Through these experiences, I learned how to communicate effectively with clients and how to work collaboratively to achieve common goals.\nIdenhaus Team is incredibly friendly and helpful. Hanno Ekdahl, Kimber Householder, Ronald Bowron, Leah Livingston, Prajna Priyadarshini, Sajid Shafique TJ Rubeck, and Sandhya Sukumar will always have my gratitude for their guidance, leadership, and kindness.\nIn conclusion, my experience as a Cybersecurity Intern at Idenhaus Consulting, LLC has been nothing short of incredible. I have learned so much and had the opportunity to work with and learn from some of the most talented professionals in the industry.

Iâ€™ve had a great time learning how to grow this business and working with a team that likes to get things done. Itâ€™s been a huge pleasure to learn from everyone about website management and how to run a client-friendly sales process. One of the coolest things about this internship was how involved I was in the whole accounting process. Getting that first-hand knowledge completely opened my eyes to how a business operates. \nAt first, I thought this internship would be more than I could handle but everyone made it a super smooth and welcoming experience for me. If I had any questions or interest in another area of the business, I was told how the process worked and why it was so. I would say one of the biggest changes for me in this internship would be my confidence, I havenâ€™t once felt like I couldnâ€™t do something as I have always had the proper guidance at Legendary Labradoodles. Huge thanks to the CEO Mrs. Barhill for being very transparent and willing to explain in detail how to operate a successful company. \nOverall, Iâ€™ve learned significantly more than I thought I would at this internship. From refining my ability to communicate with everyone from a remote position to my understanding of automating an accounting process and everything in between, I was able to refine my skills in leaps and bounds. Now this internship has been Legendary (no pun intended) but what really sent it to the moon was the fact that I was doing it all for adorable puppies.

It was an excellent chance to learn about and get exposed to various fields of expertise, some of which were new to me. I recently met my supervisor and the director of Northern Compass, who guided me along the route. I am sincerely appreciative to have made these connections. These technical skills, including front-end development, data management, SQL Server Management Studio, Visual Studios, Tableau, and back-end development, have been a terrific experience for me. It was a fantastic way for me to feel comfortable asking thoughtful questions and expanding my understanding of these technical skills to know that my employer supported learning and had made resources available for me to use.\nI worked closely with the Northern Compass director the whole time I was an intern, discussing requirements and carrying out my duties. During this internship, the director trained me to use SQL Server Management Studio, Visual Studios, Figma, and Tableau for upcoming projects he assigned me. For my project, I used SQL Server Management Studios to build databases, run queries, and write SQL Server scripts. I had to ask questions, take notes, and practice hands-on while learning to run queries and write SQL scripts. It was very challenging for me for the first time while learning SQL. I got hands-on experience when I was practicing and taking notes every day to gain these technical skills. I also had to learn how to use Figma software for my project. It was a fun experience when I was learning how to design mobile applications for my training provided by the director of Northern Compass.\nReflecting on my time at Northern Compass, I'm thankful for my experiences and the lovely individuals I met. I will never forget that experience and my time at Northern Compass. My experience at Northern Compass has been incredible, and I will never forget it. To summarize the internship, Northern Compass is an IT business consulting company that aids companies in solving complex problems involving networks, data, and software.

Sitting in an unfamiliar room, listening to talks of procedure and policy, I was a bit nervous, yet excited, for what was to come.\nNow, it is Mayâ€”four months laterâ€”and I can proudly say that I am writing this article in reflection of one of the most enjoyable and valuable experiences of my life thus far. Interning with the AHA has been truly eye-opening, and I will never forget this period of learning and growth.\nUnder the supervision of internal audit manager Chris Lewis, and with the support of internal auditor Nicole Powell, I quickly learned a multitude of key methodologies and techniques of the profession through hands-on experience and direct involvement with key projects. I would like to extend my thanks to these individuals, as well as to national VP of internal audit Beatrice Njuguna, internal auditor Colleen Parsons, and internship program lead Kathy Young for their continued support throughout my time with the AHA.\nMy first considerable undertaking as an internal audit intern was a review of the organizationâ€™s conflict of interest policies and procedures. Specifically, I pulled and examined a sample of boards of directors and their meetings to gain an understanding of each boardâ€™s conflict-of-interest-related processes. Utilizing Microsoft Excel and Diligent HighBond, I conducted extensive attribute testing that led to conversations with leaders from each region. The knowledge acquired through this process resulted in discussions of board responsibility among members of the organization and ensured proper adherence to company policies and standards.\nMy most significant project, however, was a revenue testing audit that I was given the opportunity to lead. This project involved examining samples of various types of revenue to discover potential instances of noncompliance among those involved in the reporting process. By making use of a variety of documentation in relation to Microsoft Excel and JD Edwards EnterpriseOne, I was able to conduct this process in an efficient and effective manner, once more leading to important deliberations among those within the organization. The level of agency provided to me throughout this project helped me grow my skills from both interpersonal and technical angles and allowed me to better understand the perspectives of numerous departments across the organization.\nTo be able to be part of the AHA has truly been a great privilege. The missions strived toward, and impacts created by, the AHA are immensely valuable to our society, and as a result of my exposure to such aspects throughout my internship, I have been inspired to create a positive effect of my own within society and the world at large.

My direct supervisor, Liz Pettengill, was key in helping me achieve my goals throughout the internship as she guided me throughout the different reports and projects I worked on. I met many new people throughout the internship who gave me more insight of the company and how different departments of the agency work together to achieve their goals.

While at Emergent, I was tasked with various duties ranging from U.S equities analysis and industry analysis to portfolio management and manager selection. From the very first day, I was entrusted with many responsibilities and duties that, many of which I had never done in my past work experiences. I learned a myriad of concepts and teachings about the market at Emergent that a classroom simply can't teach. The mentors and leaders at the firm were truly inspiring and would take every opportunity to teach me something new about what the firm does and the industry. It was very nice to remain in Texas and work in Houston, a city I thoroughly enjoyed (despite the heat).

Morgan Chase, with a background spanning more than 200 years. J.P. Morgan is a pioneer in asset management, commercial banking, investment banking, and the processing of financial transactions. J.P. Morgan provides services to millions of customers in the United States and several of the most illustrious corporate, institutional, and governmental clients worldwide.  \nI got the opportunity to work as a Team lead for the J.P. Morgan Chase travel industry. Although I never had a travel background besides purchasing tickets. I stepped ahead and took the opportunity. Then a question struck my mind what does this position have to do with my major? Which is information systems and technology.  I didnâ€™t know how to answer it right then; however, once I stepped into the role, everything started falling into place. My main task was supervising a group of more than 20 help desk representatives to ensure they were achieving the company's key performance indicators (KPIs). If they weren't, I had to identify their growth opportunities and help them strengthen in those areas by providing them with positive feedback and coaching. I also had secondary tasks such as preparing training material for the new hire agents and assisting them with onboarding. \nAt first, it all seemed difficult. However, from the support I received from my supervisors and peers, I could get on my feet and run my team. The first deliverable of my project was to provide a read-out to my site director about my teamâ€™s performance and KPI every month. Tracking the KPI and team performance was challenging, as I had data from several reports that I had to filter out, cleanse, identify the outliers, and put together in a presentable manner for my monthly readout. Looking at the data, I quickly realized that the actual work environment data is far more complex than the data I encountered in school. The difference in data and duration of the deliverable forced me to step outside my comfort zone and create something meaningful from the data I had. With the data analytic skills I learned in school, I used tools such as Excel to create graphs and analyze my team's performance for the deliverable. I found this task difficult as I wasnâ€™t as proficient as I thought in Excel. I had to network and seek assistance from my peers, who taught me shortcuts and functions I never knew. With my peers' support and service, I successfully created my read-out report and presented it to my site director. \nOverall, the internship experience at J.P. Morgan Chase was terrific. Each day was a new adventure and an opportunity to learn something new and develop new skills. There was never a moment where I felt unsupported; the management took care of my needs. With this experience, I look forward to further pursuing my career with J.P. Morgan Chase. \n#UTDBSITS #JSOMINTERN #JSOM "", '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines), Personal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'Bank of Montreal is the first Canadian bank founded in Montreal in 1817.

The concept of Global Ed is to provide opportunities for professional development through education programs. The company is in Anthem, Arizona, and the goal is to give students a greater sense of self-awareness by having a diverse culture. I am grateful that throughout the internship course, I have gained many technical skills that I did not have before this course. This internship brought me an inner confidence that I did not have before. I improved being an active listener and learned to develop good communication skills. \nDuring this internship, I worked as a Product Development and IT Consultant, understanding the business needs and designing and implementing technological solutions to deliver a new consulting product. Multiple groups were assigned for different tasks, but the position I was working for only had Jackeline, my project manager, for this internship. Our supervisor had asked my project manager and me to research the best cloud-based management platforms for small businesses to create and maintain their social media campaigns. We aimed to centralize all services under one roof and develop APIs as needed. As an Information Technology major, I brought out the IT expertise I gained through The University of Texas at Dallas. At the same time, my project manager was more toward the marketing side. We came up with solutions that were developing and make sure they fit into the business model. While meeting in-person weekly, we used Trello to ensure every task was completed before the next meeting. My project manager and I had set goals and communicated daily to ensure we were on the same page and the tasks were being done on time. Through this internship, I learned a lot about IT systems and the platforms being used; it taught me leadership as I used all my technical IT skills. My biggest challenge was using cloud-based tools to perform a snapshot and competition analysis. One of the biggest things I learned was adaptability. My project manager and I had to adapt to certain situations as only two members were in the group. Through my supervisor, I learned problem-solving skills and how to present in presentations with other companies. \nIn conclusion, this internship taught me how to stay calm when a challenge comes because anything can happen in the real world, so we must do our preparation before to keep on top of things. This opportunity led me to gain real professional working experience. I am delighted that my project manager and supervisor guided me whenever I accomplished my goals and enhanced my skills. \n#UTDBSITS #JSOMINTERN #JSOM ', '\n\t\t\tFaculty referral\t\t\t', 'Bank of Montreal is the first Canadian bank founded in Montreal in 1817.

Unlike some of my fellow interns, this isn't my first time in the industry. With a decade of experience in IT, I decided to pursue a Master's degree to expand my knowledge and skills in Cybersecurity and other emerging technologies. I was eager to gain practical experience and further develop my skills in this field, which led me to land an internship at Idenhaus Consulting, LLC - a renowned consulting firm known for its exceptional work in Identity Management and Cybersecurity.\nI began my internship journey in February 2023 and over the next few months, I had the opportunity to work on a project that involved developing a strategy and roadmap for a client. The project required me to analyze the client's current state and develop a future state plan, including a detailed design of IAM implementation and other recommendations. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience to develop a roadmap along with the guidance of IAM experts at Idenhaus, that maximized value and minimized implementation risk for the client. Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of the IAM implementation stages and processes and learned how to plan the implementation and communicate effectively with clients to achieve common goals.\nIn addition to the strategy and roadmap project, I also started working on tool configurations and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) setup for clients. This allowed me to gain hands-on experience in implementing IAM solutions and understanding how different tools and technologies work together to enhance security.As part of my internship at Idenhaus Consulting, LLC, I had the opportunity to contribute to the company's technical blog, by writing a post on 'Implementing IAM using Concurrent Engineering Principles: A Collaborative Approach to Securing Digital Identities.' The post tackled the issue of organizations treating IAM as a technical installation rather than a collaborative effort. I even presented an idea for a lunch and learn session that was centered around security and sustainability. The idea aimed to solve a real-life issue and was well-received by the team. Additionally, I am working towards getting partner certifications, which will not only enhance my knowledge but also benefit the company in the long run.\nThe leaders at Idenhaus Consulting Hanno Ekdahl , Kimber Householder, Ronald Bowron, Jerry Combs, CISSP are not only approachable but also powerhouses of knowledge. Their expertise in the field of IAM and cybersecurity is remarkable, and I am constantly learning from them in every interaction. \nThe friendly and welcoming environment created by my peers Sajid Shafique, Prajna Priyadarshini, Leah Livingston, Fnu Tarana, TJ Rubeck , Addy Agee Richard Hawes made my experience even more enjoyable. Overall, my internship experience at Idenhaus Consulting, LLC has opened the doors to the world of cybersecurity for me, and I am excited to see where my future endeavors in this field take me.\n#cybersecurity#internship#experience hashtag#consulting #The University of Texas at Dallas #UTDMSITM "", '\n\t\t\tPersonal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'During my internship at Technosoft Corporation, I was assigned to work on a government-based project ...', 'Greetings everyone!!\n\nI am extremely happy and grateful to have received internship of ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

As a Business Development and IT analyst we were required to take on a problem and come up with IT solutions that would solve the problem and then implement those solutions into practice. Our first project was to help a dog walking business handle the large amounts of inquires they were getting and to create a system that would allow users to have a holistic view of the business which included jobs, contact information, vet information, and sections to handle billing. Working with a team, we designed an IOS application on Figma that would later be implemented into a working application using XML and .NET code. This project allowed me to take my technical skills of networking and coding and put them to use in a real life business situation. The ability to understand technology is one thing, but before this experience, I like many who lacked real world experience had difficulty seeing how these technical IT skills could be implemented into a non-IT business (Dog walking) other than the obvious IT roles, but the owner of Northern Compass Robert Donovan gave a clear message of thinking of these skills such as coding and networking as tools and to not be limited by them when you are trying to come up with solutions. The second part of the project involved us creating a web design within Figma and beginning coding on the IOS application using XML. Along with these, through my curiosity and the acknowledgment of Robert, I began working on AZURE B2C and designing user login and signup flows which picked my interest due to me wanting to one day enter the Cybersecurity field. One more thing that I took from this internship that was not from a project but from a meeting was regarding the future of our careers and AI. Robert Donovan showed us a couple of examples on how powerful these AI technologies are getting and how they could affect us in the future. He gave a message on how we should learn to work with these technologies to make us better candidates for future employment. Things that would take days would now take seconds and we should focus on how we can optimize our workflows to become efficient and valuable assets to a corporation. This experience was eye opening for me and has taught me a lot on how I should be thinking about my future as a IT professional and what skills I should look to sharpen to make myself a notable candidate for jobs I plan on acquiring in the future.

This was super beneficial since the classes I would take after my internship focused on working with Tableau and I was able to connect it to real-life experience which really helped my understanding of the program grow. I was also able to have this experience working with SAP. This is because, during my time at Insight, I was able to take a trip to Hanover, IL, and work in their warehouse distribution center. I was able to see how the warehouse was designed as well as how SAP played a supportive role in the distribution process. Along with Tableau, I also took courses in SAP after my internship at Insight and was able to connect the information I was learning to real-life scenarios. I am super grateful to the team at Insight for creating such an amazing environment where I was able to work on my technical skills in a real-life setting, something that isn't easy to do during your time in college. I hope to keep developing my technical skills in a multitude of programs as I began my career in the Technology Industry.\nMy favorite thing about Insight was how strongly the company portrayed its three values, Hunger, Heart, and Harmony. These things were engrained into all that they did and even as an intern, I felt that these values were shown by each and every employee who worked at Insight. Company culture is so important to employees and can create a place for an employee to really find ambition and purpose in their career, which is why I was so amazed at how Insight as such a big company was able to achieve such a complicated but critical task.\n#UTDBSITS #JSOMINTERN #JSOM "", '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines), Personal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'I had the amazing opportunity to join USAA in Plano, Texas during the Summer as a Software Engineer  ...', 'This past year, I had the amazing opportunity to intern at Morris Technology Solutions.

The team falls under their Asset Management business unit, and early on, it became apparent just how steep this learning curve would be. My manager had described it as ""like drinking from a firehouse."" I was thirsty to learn and excited for the opportunity to be in an industry I had been attempting to break into for a while.\nSince I started, I have had multiple large projects assigned to me. I have used Python to automate business processes, building Power BI reports from scratch, including designing the data model and developing the SQL queries, writing DAX formulas, and posting them into the workspace for our users to access. I have also assisted in configuring and maintaining support for our Power BI apps that include paginated reports as we convert over from SSRS to Power BI as our primary source for reports. \nThe last couple of months has been intensely focused on rewriting and rebuilding nearly 200 reports as we migrate into a new server and new data structures. This change was necessitated by developing an in-house platform with our Technology teams. My team, QA, helps provide support through input on database design, functionality testing, data inaccuracies, and troubleshooting. \nThrough the thousands of lines of SQL that I have redeveloped, the dozens of reports reconfigured to use the new structure, and the many conversations surrounding the launch and formation of this new platform. I have found out just how phenomenal Lument Capital is. I would not have been able to grow and learn as quickly as this if it was not for the company\'s culture.

The company is based in Seville, Spain, but I was fortunate enough to collaborate with Northern Compass, an IT consulting company, to work in a remote environment.\n\tI received my offer from GlobalEd to work as an IT Analyst and Business Development Intern in January of this year. While reading my offer, I was thrilled to learn that the project I would be working on would involve building an app to help individuals manage their small businesses, more specifically in the pet services industry. I would be working with a team of 6 to complete this project in hopes of meeting all objectives before the end of the semester. Prior to moving forward with the project and creating the app, our company supervisor provided us with the tools needed to succeed in a remote work environment, as almost everyone on the team had no experience working remotely. This included video lectures on efficiently using collaborative tools, effectively presenting online, and a resume workshop which I found the most helpful. \n\tAfter meeting with our supervisor, we decided to initiate the first step of our app using Figma, a cloud-based prototyping tool to create user interfaces and digital products, with the goal of creating a design for the app. Due to conflicting schedules within our team, we decided it would be best to create individual designs and later on collaborate on a final design with all of the team memberâ€™s ideas. I had zero experience in UI design when I first began, but dozens of hours just learning the controls, features, and capabilities of Figma. After weeks of consistent effort, I presented my work to the supervisors, and they were delighted with my app design proposal. Our supervisors decided to go with one main app design created by my teammate Alixandria, who presented a fantastic app prototype and split the team into two. One team to work on the database or Microsoft Azure end of the app, and one team to work on a functioning website design. I chose to work on Azure as I knew that many organizations around the world use Azure and saw this as a chance to expand my knowledge in the IT Industry.\n\tOverall, my internship experience at Global Education and Career Development Abroad has been splendid, and Iâ€™ve learned a lot from both my supervisors and team.

Over the past 11 months, I have worked with a dynamic and supportive team as a Customer Solutions Analyst intern. \nMy primary project was to assist in leading the implementation of our newly integrated SAP application OpenText Vendor Invoice Management (VIM), which was compatible with both SAP Fiori and SAP GUI. I would then conduct a training session on using the new application for BlueTriton employees across several teams. VIM would automate order entry, discontinue the need for manual order entry, and optimize workflows. I had to learn the system, analyze it for improvements, and test it before I could confidently do a training demo. The team of Customer Solution Analysts was happy to help answer my questions and concerns and encouraged me to include my findings, tips, and tricks in training. After successfully learning, analyzing, and testing the new system, I conducted the training and received immensely positive feedback. \nI also learned and worked with an advanced analytics tool, Power BI. I learned to access and analyze BlueTriton Power BI datasets in Excel using PivotTables. With Power BI, I could create interactive visualizations of performance reports. I learned how powerful advanced analytics is and how I can apply different techniques to make complex datasets more insightful and user-friendly. \nMy experience at BlueTriton brands has been incredibly valuable and fulfilling. From day one, I have felt a strong sense of belonging and appreciation, as every person, regardless of their role, has committed to fostering a positive, inclusive, and supportive work culture. #UTDBSITS #JSOMINTERN #JSOM "", '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines), LinkedIn helped me get this internship!\t\t\t', 'Bank of Montreal is the first Canadian bank founded in Montreal in 1817.

In order for companies to match the pace of technological growth, they would need someone to manage those resources to ensure the efficiency and productivity of their employees. IT YAâ€™LL serves that purpose by providing high-quality technical support services to small to medium-sized businesses throughout North Texas. Driven by the passion for eliminating IT problems, IT YALL has amassed over 500+ clients, making it part of their success.\nFor the last 4 months, I have had the pleasure of joining IT Yâ€™ALLâ€™s team of IT Experts as a Help Desk Intern. I couldnâ€™t have been more excited to start my first internship with the fastest-growing IT company in Dallas. My primary objective was to work side by side with a highly experienced team of support engineers to perform various applications in troubleshooting customer problems, providing detailed answers to questions, and the installation of essential software, all while maintaining strong, professional communication skills. From this experience, I would like to highlight a few lessons I learned from this opportunity.\nYou must be prepared to learn something new Every. Single. Day.\nAs a novice in the industry, I found adaptability highly critical. My first project was to transfer all client data from old computers to new ones and install the appropriate software and drivers for our clientâ€™s daily operations. This would require taking the SATA SSD drives and cloning them onto the newer M.2 SSDs. As someone who has never looked inside a computer, I needed to learn these components and understand why and how these processes improve the circumstance. However, learning on the fly comes with the caveat of mistakes and confusion. From this, I learned that,\nIt is imperative to ask questions.\nAs I became increasingly overwhelmed with industry jargon and practices, I became more insecure about my disposition. Nevertheless, my team members made it clear that, as an intern, it is vital to ask as many questions as possible. Asking for help has aided in building connections with my team by allowing them to share their experiences and ideas that will benefit me in the long run.\nFor this experience, I would like to extend my gratitude to my team, that made this journey memorable. our Founder Olivier Sosak, for seeing my potential in the field I would like to grow in; Osmin Vanegas, for being a patient mentor and incredible support engineer; our System Admin, Paul Havens, for his wisdom and expertise and Kelvin Hung, for encouraging me to pursue new skills. This experience has been incredible, and I wouldnâ€™t have been able to succeed without their guidance throughout this journey.\n#UTDBSITS #JSOMINTERN #JSOM ', '\n\t\t\tPersonal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'Bank of Montreal is the first Canadian bank founded in Montreal in 1817.

These technologies are harnessed to convert, condition, and process real-world phenomena like light, sound, temperature, motion, and pressure into electrical signals. This innovative approach has facilitated remarkable advancements in a diverse range of fields, from digitized factories and mobility to digital healthcare. Moreover, Analog Devices' pioneering solutions play a crucial role in the fight against climate change while simultaneously ensuring reliable connections between people and the world.\nAs a Reliability Engineering Intern at Analog Devices (ADI), I spent my first two weeks understanding the project requirements and the line of products ADI makes. Later, I developed optimized SQL Queries in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and used MS Excel for data cleaning and data mining from multiple databases to create views. Effectively integrated SSMS with PowerBI for publishing reports and dashboards to provide a user-friendly interface for generic ID input resulting in efficient extraction of the desired output. This, in turn, maximized productivity by achieving a 60% significant reduction in manual activities for the Product, Quality, and Reliability Engineering Teams.\nThis internship not only allowed me to strengthen my technical skills but also enhanced my management skills to bridge the gap between business requirements and technical needs. I also got the opportunity to present my work on Microsoft PowerPoint to cross-functional teamsâ€™ Managers and the leadership team.\nIâ€™m immensely grateful to Maurice Brodeur, and Daniel Tremblay for all their support and guidance at each step during the internship and I would also like to thank Brad Gifford for mentoring this team throughout. Iâ€™m so happy to be a part of this team and Analog Devices (ADI) where I have been learning a lot and enjoyed meeting amazing colleagues at the same time. \nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my program Director Mr. Mark Thouin at the University of Texas at Dallas for encouraging me to seek an internship.\n#UTDMSITM "", '\n\t\t\tGrace Hopper Conference\t\t\t', 'During my internship at Technosoft Corporation, I was assigned to work on a government-based project ...', 'Greetings everyone!!\n\nI am extremely happy and grateful to have received internship of ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

I quicky learned the importance of communication when it came to my responsibilities. It is important to ensure that the problem-solving skills and effectively and efficiently carried out for the magazineâ€™s staff work can work seamlessly. This taught me to be very patient as well as detail-oriented, as I had to understand each problem before devising a solution.\nIn addition, for help desk support, it was involved with support employees for hardware and software issues, setting up workstations, and assisting in software installation and updates.

Here I was fortunate enough to get an opportunity to work with a very talented Google BI Developer and Analytics Team.\nHow was my experience?\nWhile working on many interesting cross-functional projects I realized that data isn't just a collection of some random facts, figures, or statistics it's a collection of hidden millions of stories behind. It is a manifestation of our curiosity and our desire to find patterns and connections that help us analyze the complex ever-changing reality we live in. It is a strong tool to extract meaning from the chaos of the universe that gives us the power to predict and control our way of living.\nDuring my projects, I focused on understanding the stakeholders' requirements and their stories to create meaningful and actionable insights through data analytics. I learned to listen carefully to their needs and work with them to develop dashboards, reports, and audit scripts that told their stories and conveyed the data's significance. To accomplish these tasks, I leveraged various tools such as Google PLX Scripts, PLX dashboards, and Google SQL. To automate the scripts' execution, I additionally employed workflows and script schedulers. Working with project management tools like task flow helped me get acquainted with the Agile environment where the workload was divided into manageable chunks to stay on track and meet priority deadlines thus maintaining my productivity.\nBy telling these stories, I helped my stakeholders make informed decisions based on the data, improving their business operations and strategies. This experience taught me the importance of not just analyzing data but also understanding the context behind it and telling its story. It helped me realize that data analytics is not just about numbers and trends but also about the stories behind them. The most important lesson that I learned during my internship was the significance of thinking analytically to design the most effective and efficient solutions. I also learned how to create reliable, robust, and error-free scripts that can withstand the most complex cases.\nWhat am I grateful for?\nThis internship was an important step in my career journey, and I know that there is still much to learn and accomplish. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude towards my manager Shravanti Sri, Muhiddin Celik, and Vijay TY and my team who guided me so well during my entire course of the internship, and Shafiq Mohammed who trusted me with this opportunity\nI am grateful to all my professors, at Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas, this has been an amazing journey and I am truly thankful for it.\n#utd#jsom #utdmsitm #springinternship2023 #dataanalytics #Internshipexperience #intelliswift "", 'During my internship at Technosoft Corporation, I was assigned to work on a government-based project ...', 'Greetings everyone!!\n\nI am extremely happy and grateful to have received internship of ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

Since the data we were given had numerous categories that were driving the numbers, I ranked each category from 1 to 20 to show the most significant drivers. The model was also used to generate monthly reports that compared actual monthly results to the forecast.\nAdditionally, I had the opportunity to attend guest speaker events and tours that provided me with valuable insight into the operations of a large stone company. Every week, we had guest speakers who were leaders in different departments within the company, and the tours included visits to the DFW officers.\nFurthermore, I had the privilege of traveling to other states and exploring different adjacent industries. During the internship, I visited many other companies that work in the stone industry and learned about how they work together to take stone from the ground and bring it to consumers.\nLastly, I would like to express my gratitude to my mentor, Mason Meyers, for his guidance during my internship. I would also like to thank my manager, Larry Jarvis, director, Zaid Neworth, and the entire team at Omega Natural Stone for making my time with them worthwhile. #UTDBSFIN #hireJSOM ', '\n\t\t\tFaculty referral, Internet (e.g. company website, job search engines)\t\t\t', 'For the past 2 semesters, I have had the amazing opportunity to work as a finance intern at Nanoscop ...', 'My internship experience at Emersons Commercial Real Estate was amazing!

For this course, I worked on a Risk and Governance project at Citigroup.\nI managed all Risk related items for the organization with the goal of reducing the organizationâ€™s overall Risk score. I became the key point of contact for the Managerâ€™s Control Assessment (MCA) testing, alongside leading efforts in the Correction Action Plan creation and tracking process. All of these Risk related tasks required consistent, daily monitoring. I helped guarantee items that pose a risk to the organization were addressed in a proactive manner. To do this, I learned to utilize tools such as JIRA, ServiceNow, SQL, MS Office, and various in-house tools (Enterprise Entitlement Review System, Application Management Portal, Risk and Controls Dashboard). All of these tools worked to reduce the number of red/failed items flagging and target items that are upcoming due within the next 90 days, as these items can jeopardize the Risk score. The MCA tests ensured every control was in compliance. If a test passed, it indicated the control is working as intended and no alarms were needed. Additionally, I assisted in the cross-border initiative to ensure the tool, ServiceNow, was in compliance and available across the world (90+ countries). To mitigate all potential risks in the cross-border initiative, I worked very closely with my manager and our partners when meeting with various stakeholders globally.\nAlthough it was a challenging task to compile all metrics and review all the reporting, it was rewarding presenting it to Senior Management. Throughout this project, I not only got exposure to various technical tools, but I also was able to enhance my communication and presentation skills.

I work closely with my project managers and cross-functional teams to understand related goals and objectives. Using my expertise in spreadsheets, I developed a cost template that allowed other team members to compile relevant study abroad costs in the new destinations.\nMarket analysis was an essential part of the project and I dug in to understand the competition.

Throughout my tenure in this internship, I have effectively employed various concepts gained during my graduate studies at UT Dallas, including object-oriented programming, Data Management, and cloud-based services, specifically Amazon Web Services (AWS). Within the context of this internship project, I was granted the opportunity to contribute to a significant organizational endeavor known as ""Rank Update."" The project entails regular updates to user ratings and reviews, alongside providing recommendations based on user input.\nThe process begins with the receipt of real-time input from the user whenever a new review is added to the existing website. Subsequently, the AWS Lambda function is triggered, starting the update of product ratings. Within this process, the most recent comments and ratings provided by the user are added to a stack. Using Python, real-time metrics, such as average rating and rating per category are updated accordingly. This information is then stored in DynamoDB, facilitating faster inference, and enabling the website statistics to be refreshed from this DynamoDB source.\nIn addition, the update of ratings per class occurs through the utilization of predefined filters, encompassing region-wise, rating-wise, and timestamp-wise categorizations within multiple regions, namely North America (NA) and Asia. The website\'s primary display consistently queries the most recent reviews from DynamoDB, ensuring that the end user is presented with up-to-date review information at all times.\nI have implemented additional support as user-based queries that use a predefined set of filters. By applying these filters to the entire dataset, the website can display the most recent reviews that satisfy the specified criteria. To accomplish this, I proposed a straightforward API call that effectively filters the reviews and subsequently populates the display with the latest reviews that meet the specified filter requirements. This approach not only ensures the provision of more precise reviews, but also enhances the users\' comprehension of product performance, improving their decision-making capabilities in purchasing the product.\nLast, I express my heartfelt gratitude to my manager, Shivani Pandit, at the organization, whose unwavering support, guidance, and mentorship have been invaluable throughout my internship journey. In this role, I have gained a profound understanding of the significance of writing code as a long-term solution, ensuring code updates are well-documented in GitHub, conducting code reviews with peers, and effectively scaling applications for organization-level projects. Besides my manager\'s exceptional support, I would also like to extend my appreciation to our program Director professor Mark Thouin, and professor Gaurav Shekhar, #utdmsitm, #jsom for continuous support and motivation.

They really made me feel like part of the team right from the get-go. On first day, I was wandering around trying to find my cage when a coworker helped me setup my workspace and the Fidelity\'s Corporate Audit - Brokerage team even treated me to a welcoming lunch. \nThis would set the tone for the rest of my internship!\nDuring the first month of my co-op at Fidelity, I had the privilege of setting up one-on-one meetings with various Product Area Leaders (PALs), who shared invaluable insights about their experience working at the company. I distinctly recall one PAL sharing a valuable piece of advice that has stuck with me: ""Once you learn the business side of IT, you are golden"". This advice has proven to be very true and insightful as I continue to grow and develop my skills in the field.\nHence, as a co-op, my primary objective was to gain exposure to the end-to-end audit lifecycle. Participating in various phases of audits was crucial in enabling me to acquire a deeper understanding of the business operations.  \nâ— As an audit analyst, I have been involved in financial audit ensuring company\'s financial reporting is accurate and operational audits assessing operating policies and procedures for efficiency and effectiveness. I have gained a deep understanding of the business. I achieved this by actively participating in the audit planning, preparation of audit test workpapers, which helped to document and track the audit process, identify areas of risk, and provide recommendations to management for improvement. Being part of an agile work culture has played a key role in improving my ability to manage time effectively, communicate more efficiently, and prioritize tasks better. \nâ— I gained valuable hands-on experience in data analytics. This involved ETL and data cleansing, as well as audit planning and reviewing accounts for Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance, Consumer Price Index (CPI) and transactions to see internal control failure and limit fraud. Overall, my experience allowed me to develop a range of data analytics skills and gain insight into the important role that internal audit plays in ensuring compliance and identifying risks in a company\'s operations using Power BI, Excel, and Python.\nHaving encountered few challenges during my internship, I believe that I have been able to broaden my horizons and gain a new outlook on various aspects of the job. \nI would like to thank my manager Kimberly Rosner, squad lead Christopher Earle, and team for their perfectly curated guidance and wealth of knowledge they have chosen to share with me. This has been an incredible experience. I will forever be indebted to this program!\nThank you, Prof. Gaurav Shekhar, Sivya Leventhal and JSOM for giving me this amazing opportunity. \n#UTD #JSOM #UTDMSBA #internship #fidelity #fidelityintern #fidelityassociate ', '\n\t\t\tJSOM Handshake, Internet (e.g. company website, job search engines), Personal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'I have been interning with Crescent Bank since June 2022, and it has been a joyful, rich, and memora ...', 'My Graduate Internship at Tenaska Power Services was one of the most rewarding experiences I have ha ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

In this new experience, one of the biggest things I learned is that even though the industry of the company was not the most familiar topic for me in the beginning, as a working profession in the accounting/finance field, the basics of accounting is what really matters and having a solid foundation of this understanding helped me learn and grow in this position at JLL in the most efficient and effective way. \nAs someone who had no prior knowledge or experience in commercial real estate as well as corporate accounting, I was honestly pretty intimidated by many things that I had to learn in the beginning and started to doubt my abilities as a Financial Analyst. But with the help and support from my manager, director, and my teammates, the doubts I had about myself quickly turned into confidence and ownership over my responsibilities. I realized that I was simply applying the basic accounting knowledge that I learned from my Masters in Accounting program at the University of Texas at Dallas and adding in corporate skills in the commercial real estate practices and it was not intimidating and confusing as I had imagined it all to be.\nThe best part of this whole experience though, is undoubtedly my relationships I was able to build with my coworkers. I am more than thankful to say that the support that I receive from my manager not only helped me grow as an employee, but also in my mental and emotional well being. I also had many conversations with coworkers that inspired me and encouraged me to keep exploring in my career as I continue to develop as an accountant.

I also initiated creating the JIRA dashboard, queries and intend to use this tool to track project progress and status for larger projects in future, to ensure that the project always remain on track. I had prior experience in JIRA and that totally helped me during my internship while doing this.\nWorking on an AI project allowed me to develop my technical knowledge and understanding of the field. Coordinating with AI engineers gave me a broader perspective on the potential applications of artificial intelligence and the challenges that come with implementing these solutions. This experience also highlighted the importance of cross-functional collaboration and communication to ensure successful project outcomes.\nAs a Technical Project Manager, I had numerous client meetings, which allowed me to understand the importance of active listening, effective communication, and problem-solving.

I was hired by BMO as a Business Analyst as part of the First Year Program in the Transportation Finance sector. I cannot begin to describe my year at this wonderful company. Not only did I learn many technical skills but also had many unforgettable experiences.\nDuring my first few months at BMO, I got to go around multiple campuses across Texas for recruiting events and career fairs with our talented HR Recruiter, Justin Stephens, and multiple coworkers. I got to educate many students across campuses about who BMO is and their culture. I guided students interested in this role and described what my role entails and my responsibilities as a Business Analyst.\nIn my next few months at BMO, I got to work on multiple projects and learned many technical skills. I worked on and learned about different applications like Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and Oracle Siebel CRM. I have learned about testing and application integration. I actively worked on projects with teams using the agile methodology. Furthermore, I got more familiar with SQL as I worked on looking at numerous tables, fields, and schemas for projects.\nAnother important thing that I value now more than ever is building relationships and working together as a team. We have always worked in teams in university for numerous projects but working in teams at BMO really taught me how important it is to communicate and understand your teammates. I have met many wonderful people at BMO. Everyone is from a diverse background and they possess different skills they excel at. Listening to multiple viewpoints and hearing their perspective can truly change the outcome of a situation or even resolve an issue at hand.\nIâ€™m extremely grateful for this opportunity and so proud to be a part of BMO. I hope to continue to grow my career with BMO and look forward to what the future holds for me. I just want to thank Justin Stephens for being there for me throughout this program, and my Director, Chip Wyatt, for being a great mentor and guiding me toward a successful future.\n#UTDBSITS ', '\n\t\t\tPersonal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'During my summer internship with Global Education and Career Development Abroad (GlobalEd), I had th ...', 'This past spring I had the privilege to Intern at LED USA.

I have learned so much over the past few months that I have been here. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity that I was given here, and forever will be.\nThis accounting internship has given me so much insight into the both the real estate world and the accounting world as well! This internship has given me a lot of knowledge about the cash flows that come from a commercial property. It also has taught me how to navigate different software that is used for property accounting such as the Yardi Voyager software. In addition to teaching me new things, this internship has helped me to further develop my existing skills, the biggest ones being time management, communication, and the use of Microsoft Excel. My time management skills were really put to its limits because of all the different projects and reports I was handling at the same time. My communication skills were greatly improved because I was constantly working alongside the accounts receivable and accounts payable department to make sure the account reconciliations were accurate. Finally, my skills regarding Microsoft Excel became more refined because I would have to use spreadsheets a lot to compile, organize, and review financial reports.\nI would especially like to thank Adam Spinn, the VP of Finance over at Emersons, who has been mentoring me and teaching me about property accounting over the past few months. He was very patient and professional with me, which led me to ask a lot of questions and learn so much about property accounting!\nOverall, I am so grateful to have been given this wonderful opportunity to learn and develop new and existing skills from this internship. #UTDBSFIN #hireJSOM ', '\n\t\t\tJSOM Handshake\t\t\t', 'For the past 2 semesters, I have had the amazing opportunity to work as a finance intern at Nanoscop ...', 'This spring I had the opportunity to intern at 5 Star Opportunities LLC  as a Financial Loan Intern. ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

My special project consisted of running a social media profile for our store in which we highlighted fun and prominent moments in our location. Showcasing the company culture allowed for the overall goal of attracting potential candidates to apply and schedule interviews for our spring/summer season. During the process of creating the account I was amazed at the opportunities that arise from using apps like Instagram. There are various features within the blog that allows for one to properly strategize engagements with followers. Instantly finding out that a profile can be converted into a business account, generated a lot of beneficial features. For example, analytically the app allows for tracking of specific days and hours in which a publication can reach a certain amount of attraction. As a result, with my experience I was genuinely impressed with how the use of technology has allowed companies to increase participation from a desired group efficiently. My purpose was to document the storeâ€™s culture to retain candidates and successfully it worked. Digital marketing does work effectively to reach specific measures within a business in this case enhancing networking opportunities. I am very grateful to have been able to participate in this project and am excited to continue to identify various recruitment styles that will benefit future job positions in the social media world.  #UTDMSMSc ', '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines), Personal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague), Full-time employment at Abercrombie & Fitch\t\t\t', 'My Possibilities is the company where I served my internship that turned into a full-time position.  ...', 'As my internship at Cognitus comes to a close, I want to take some time to speak about my experience ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

As a Data Analyst intern, I was working with their Healthcare department. \nIt was a fantastic opportunity to be coached by one of the team's most experienced members. I was given the opportunity to engage with and investigate real-time data. The internship not only helped me improve my technical abilities but also allowed me to collaborate directly with members of other departments. Using SQL and MS Excel, I created and arranged weekly analytical reports that were distributed to various departments within the organization.\nCustom requests of various sorts were accommodated, which required the creation of complicated SQL queries to assure the correctness of the obtained data. Updated, edited, and maintained two online dashboards that use interactive charts and tables to present the submitted data. It also helped me get a better understanding of the AWS console and its tools which are used frequently to run queries on Athena, store customers' data on an s3 bucket, and warehouse the data using Redshift.\nCourses like Data management and many others that I studied at UTD have helped me address daily business difficulties at work, therefore improving my abilities obtained from this experience even more. Apart from building dashboards, my visualization abilities were put to the test when I was developing and updating key sections of the corporate website as part of my initial assignments to begin my experience as an intern. \nThroughout my internship, I have been honing my digital, interpersonal, and professional abilities. I have embraced problem-solving and documenting my weekly reports to my mentors. Iâ€™ve got expertise working on a real-time big data project and then transforming it into useful graphics that aid business teams. I have improved my problem-solving abilities as well as my technical understanding of SQL, AWS, and Tableau.\nI would like to thank my entire team for giving me such a wonderful experience.

The company is a leading semiconductor company that specializes in the design and manufacturing of radio frequency solutions that can be found ""all around you"". Qorvo plays a crucial role in the development of wireless communication, defense, and aerospace technology. Their commitment to research and development has propelled them to the forefront of the industry, allowing them to deliver cunning edge technology to cater the market. \nAt Qorvo, I interned as Procurement and Planning Business Analyst. I collaborated with close cross-functioning teams, and with other teams across the nation, to meet business needs. This position allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge into the real world as I was immersing myself into the world of strategic planning and data analytics. I was first tasked with creating a report on Tableau to easily view quantitative metrics that would assist FAB managers with making business decisions. After familiarizing myself with Tableau my manager assigned me my second project which was also creating another report. However, this project required me to develop a custom SQL query that would be quicker and more efficient when drawing data. Through this project I was also introduced to SAP; a system that is used to integrate and streamline business processes. Over the course of this internship, I learned that real world data is much more complex compared to what is provided in school as it is more difficult to read and manipulate. Because of this I spent extensive time learning best practices for SQL query development. I also met with senior employees to teach me how to navigate through the SAP software.\nTo conclude, my journey as a Procurement and Planning Business Analyst Inter at Qorvo Incorporated was amazing. I am incredibly grateful for the invaluable experiences and growth I acquired during my time here. This internship experience provided me the perfect backdrop for honing my skills and working alongside talented individuals. I would like to thank Qorvo, Inc. for giving me a chance to be apart of their team and help contribute to their mission. I would also like to thank my manager Shawn Hill for being an excellent mentor and guiding me along the way providing me with insightful knowledge into this field of work. #UTDBSITS #JSOMINTERN #JSOM ', '\n\t\t\tInternet (e.g. company website, job search engines)\t\t\t', 'As I start to wrap up my last week of my summer internship, I wanted to share about the incredible l ...', ""I'm excited to share my Summer 2023 internship journey with Mary Kay Inc., a Cosmetics and Beauty co ..."", 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"

In this internship position, I worked diligently to assist the managers and salespeople at the dealership in day-to-day operations. I assisted the GMC/Buick finance manager every week by taking large cash deposits to the bank. I also learned about the finance department’s day to day work activities. For example, I learned how salespeople collaborate with finance managers to get their customer\'s credit applications approved. In addition, I was responsible for handling the funds allocated for the weekly company-sponsored lunches.\nMy business communications class taught me a lot about how to communicate in a professional environment, and I used the knowledge I gained from this class to conduct myself professionally when interacting with managers and salespeople. Similarly, I learned about inventory and supply chain processes in my supply chain management class at JSOM. I realized that a new car dealership must pay close attention to its inventory levels and supply chain. For example, the sales managers have to coordinate with the car manufacturers, so they have an adequate number of vehicles on hand to sell. It is also vital that the managers have a list of which vehicles they currently have on the lot to keep track of what they have for potential customers.\nOn the other hand, I worked very closely with the commercial sales manager at the dealership. He was an incredible mentor to me and taught me a lot about the unique aspects of the car business. For example, I learned that the dealership makes more profit on commercial vehicles when compared to retail cars, which means that commercial vehicles have a higher profit margin per unit. However, the commercial manager said the commercial department holds its inventory longer, and holding stock for a longer time would mean that you have a lower inventory turnover ratio. The company can counteract this by ensuring the commercial department does not ""overstock"" its inventory. This information was very beneficial as it showed me how inventory levels can affect profitability in the automotive industry.\n Ultimately, this working experience helped me better understand the automotive industry. I have always loved cars, and I hope to one day work in auto finance as a career. I am grateful to everyone who has allowed me to work alongside them at James Wood Auto Park. #UTDBSFIN #hireJSOM ', '\n\t\t\tPersonal connection (e.g. family, friend, colleague)\t\t\t', 'Alhumdulillah! \nThis summer, I had the opportunity to work with Compass Minerals as a Finance ...', 'During my recent internship at Elysian Capital, I worked in the acquisitions department, where I ide ...', 'Copyright © 2023, All rights reserved.800 W Campbell Road,Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705']"
